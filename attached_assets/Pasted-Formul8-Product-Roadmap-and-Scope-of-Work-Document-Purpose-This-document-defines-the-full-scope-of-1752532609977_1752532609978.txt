Formul8 Product Roadmap and Scope of Work

Document Purpose: This document defines the full scope of work for the development of Formul8, a modular AI-powered consultant platform designed to serve cannabis operators across cultivation, processing, manufacturing, and retail. It is intended for internal developer guidance and will later be adapted for investors and enterprise clients.
Core Product Vision: Formul8 leverages multi-agent AI orchestration with internal proprietary datasets and expert system logic. A key differentiator is its Agent-to-Agent Verification layer, where multiple specialized agents interact, validate each other's outputs, and generate refined, consensus-based answers for the end user.

Phase 1 — Core Functional Agents (Modules)
All agents below are to be developed simultaneously as part of the MVP. There is no sequential priority in Phase 1.
Kevin’s note from Vrson call- Check for Discrepancies. Make sure the AI notifies the user when discrepancies are noted. Consider human intervention. Another selling point to ensure hallucinations are minimized and AI answers are production-ready.

1. Compliance Agent
Primary Responsibilities:
Provide up-to-date regulatory guidance across jurisdictions for various purposes to the user
Interacts with all agents
Cross-check SOPs, product formulations, and operational practices against internal regulatory databases
Alert users to compliance risks and upcoming regulatory changes, or even upcoming comments, live sessions, or other similar events by regulators. Potential to be tied into existing calendars or event sindicators
Can be defined based on users interests or location
Primary KPI- accuracy of answer.
Core Functionalities:
Formula & Process Regulatory Check
Internal DB check for pre-vetted formulations
External source scan for jurisdiction-specific compliance
Ability to get human verified answers or guidance
SOP Verification
Compares user SOPs against trained internal templates and external resources
Adding proprietary Foruma8 data and templates  will be key here
Including jurisdiction specific SOP requirements
Assesses jurisdictional validity before external lookup
Lookup additional data that is checked for how up to date it is, that we scrub for and keep updated
Facility Compliance & AHJ Code Checks
Search internal code references and verify with latest codes
API references for ICC, OSHA, and local safety code access
Licensing Compliance (e.g. CRA)
Extracts and parses PDF documents from municipal or state sites
Very important that it has an accurate and solid PDF reader
County-level focus in Phase 1; link to local resources
Phase 2 + expands to more city and local level (depending on the ability to gather and keep updated such data)
May include Simplifya scraping or similar service integration, we would like to identify the strongest solution in this category. 
Testing Requirements
Region-specific required test panels, thresholds
Testing labeling requirements 
Marketing Compliance
Flags child-appealing language or design

Help highlighting important factors related to creating SOPs 
Auto-classifies expenses into COGs categories for minimizing 280e losses. 
Internal Database Examples:

Layer
What happens under the hood
Metrics to surface
Retriever
Pulls top-N law or data chunks from vector DB.

Unknown alert – clusters novel peaks, links to Formulation agent for R&D.


ISO-ready PDF – auto-formatted COA with inline chromatograms.


Quick summary
Prepare an open file – vendor raw data are first converted to .mzML (or .mgf) so any program can read the spectra ccms-ucsd.github.io.


Drag-and-drop or POST – the user drags that file onto the Spectra Agent’s upload panel (built with a React “drop-zone”) or sends it via an HTTPS API react-dropzone.js.orgmedium.comblog.alexdevero.com.


Backend unpacks each spectrum – Python readers stream every MS/MS scan and its metadata pyteomics.readthedocs.io.


Convert to DreaMS tensor – intensities + metadata are stored in a compact HDF5 dataset for fast math dreams-docs.readthedocs.iohdfgroup.orgsupport.hdfgroup.orgneonscience.org.


DreaMS fingerprints & matches – the model turns each spectrum into a 1 024-number “fingerprint,” then looks for matches or contaminants in milliseconds nature.com.


COA panel appears – the user sees potency, terpene %, any red-flag contaminants, plus a PDF they can hand regulators.

DreaMS never guesses your method parameters—it reads them directly from the spectrum file’s metadata and bakes them into the vector it produces. The process happens in three spots:
1 – File format	You (or the LIMS) export data as mzML / mzXML / MGF. Those open formats already carry instrument settings such as ion mode, collision energy, adduct, precursor m/z, scan polarity, retention time and even the chromatographic column if the vendor wrote it. 
2 – Tensor build	The loader (pyteomics.mzML or pymzML) streams every scan, grabs those header fields, and writes them alongside m/z–intensity pairs into DreaMS’s ML-friendly HDF5 tensor. Each spectrum row has fixed columns: precursor_mz, charge, adduct, collision_E, ion_mode, instrument, rt, column_id, etc. 
3 – Model embedding	During pre-training the transformer learns two tasks—(a) predict masked peaks and (b) predict which of two spectra elutes first (retention-order objective). To solve that, it must pay attention to the metadata tokens it’s given; those tokens are concatenated to the peak list, so the final 1 024-number fingerprint already “knows” the method context. 

Why this works in practice
If you change collision energy from 20 eV to 35 eV, that token flips, so fingerprints from the two methods don’t alias each other.
When you fine-tune DreaMS for a new panel, you include the method tag (e.g., “HILIC_7 min”) in the few-shot spectra, so the small output head learns to pay attention only to data from that method—no cross-talk.
Because the metadata are stored in the same HDF5 row, downstream agents (QC, Formulation) can filter spectra by instrument or column without extra look-ups.
Bottom line: DreaMS “knows” your method because the spectrum file tells it, the tensor keeps it, and the transformer is trained to notice it. No hand-coding, no manual form filling—just export, upload, and the parameters ride along automatically.
