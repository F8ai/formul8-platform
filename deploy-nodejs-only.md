# Node.js-Only Deployment Configuration

## Changes Made for Deployment Fix

### 1. Simplified pyproject.toml
- Removed conflicting setuptools package configurations
- Minimal Python configuration to avoid UPM parsing issues
- Full Python configuration backed up in `pyproject.toml.backup`

### 2. Node.js Primary Deployment
- This project is designed as a Node.js application
- Python agents are optional components, not required for core functionality
- Replit Deploy will treat this as a Node.js project

### 3. Deployment Process
```bash
# Replit will automatically:
1. Detect package.json (Node.js project)
2. Run npm install
3. Execute build command: npm run build
4. Start application: npm start
```

### 4. Restoring Python Configuration (if needed)
If Python packaging is required later:
```bash
# Restore full Python configuration
cp pyproject.toml.backup pyproject.toml
```

### 5. Current Status
- ✅ TOML syntax errors fixed
- ✅ Duplicate key conflicts resolved  
- ✅ UPM parsing issues resolved
- ✅ Node.js deployment ready

The deployment should now work as a standard Node.js application without Python packaging conflicts.
