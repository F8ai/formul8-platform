      "category": "fto_basics",
      "difficulty": "basic",
      "expected_answer": "An FTO analysis evaluates whether a product or process can be developed, manufactured, or sold without infringing existing patents. It's crucial for cannabis companies to avoid costly patent litigation and ensure product launch safety.",
