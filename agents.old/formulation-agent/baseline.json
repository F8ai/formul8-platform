      "question": "What extraction method best preserves terpenes in cannabis concentrates?",
      "expected_answer": "Low-temperature methods like CO2 extraction, hydrocarbon extraction at 20-40°C, or live resin processing preserve terpenes effectively by staying below their boiling points (most terpenes boil between 150-185°C). Supercritical CO2 with temperature control and cold ethanol extraction are preferred for terpene preservation.",

      "question": "Calculate the molecular weight and LogP of THC using RDKit.",
      "expected_answer": "THC has a molecular weight of 314.46 g/mol and a LogP of approximately 6.97, indicating high lipophilicity suitable for oil-based formulations.",

      "question": "What's the optimal decarboxylation temperature and time for converting THCA to THC?",
      "expected_answer": "Optimal decarboxylation occurs at 105-120°C for 30-60 minutes, balancing complete conversion with minimal terpene loss.",

      "question": "What's the difference between winterization and dewaxing in cannabis processing?",
      "expected_answer": "Winterization removes waxes and lipids using cold ethanol (-40°C), while dewaxing uses mechanical filtration at -20°C to remove plant waxes, improving concentrate clarity and stability.",

      "question": "How does beta-caryophyllene differ from other terpenes pharmacologically?",

      "id": "form_009",
      "question": "What carrier oil is best for sublingual CBD formulations and why?",
      "expected_answer": "MCT oil or fractionated coconut oil provides optimal bioavailability for sublingual absorption due to medium-chain triglycerides that enhance cannabinoid solubility and absorption.",
