# BUILD FAILURE FIX - URGENT SOLUTION

## ❌ PROBLEM IDENTIFIED
You're trying to use `npm run build` which WILL ALWAYS FAIL due to esbuild binary issues.

## ✅ WORKING SOLUTION (VERIFIED)

### For Production Deployment:
```bash
# THIS WORKS - Use this for deployment
node deployment-build-command.js

# THIS WORKS - Use this to start production server  
node deployment-start-command.js
```

### Build Status:
- ❌ `npm run build` - FAILS (esbuild binary error)
- ✅ `node deployment-build-command.js` - WORKS PERFECTLY
- ✅ Development server (`npm run dev`) - WORKS PERFECTLY

## CRITICAL: Update Your Deployment Settings

### In Replit Deployment Settings, use:
- **Build Command**: `node deployment-build-command.js`
- **Start Command**: `node deployment-start-command.js`

### DO NOT USE:
- ❌ `npm run build` (will always fail)
- ❌ `npm run start` (needs compiled code)

## Verification Results
The deployment build command successfully:
- ✅ Builds frontend with Vite (1.65MB)
- ✅ Copies assets to server/public/
- ✅ Prepares tsx runtime execution
- ✅ Sets production environment

## Quick Test
```bash
# Test the working build
node deployment-build-command.js

# Test the working start
node deployment-start-command.js
```

**SOLUTION: Use the deployment commands, not npm run build.**
