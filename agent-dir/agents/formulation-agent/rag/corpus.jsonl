Among its therapeutic potentials, it is notable for its capacity to alleviate pain, nausea, anxiety, and more. The plant's primary secondary metabolites are cannabinoids, which interact with the endocannabinoid system to produce these effects. However, due to the dosage variability and the secondary effects associated with a lack of targeted action, their medical use is limited, creating the need for effective delivery systems. METHODOLOGY: This systematic patent review on cannabis drug delivery systems was conducted using patents retrieved from the Espacenet database. The search employed the keywords \"Cannabis\" and \"Delivery,\" along with the IPC classification code A61, to filter patents filed between 2012 and 2024. This initial search yielded 99 patents, which were further screened to identify 15 patents that met the inclusion criteria. RESULTS: Of the selected patents, most originated from the United States, followed by Canada, international patents (WIPO), and China. A notable increase in patent filings occurred in 2022, coinciding with the peak in scientific publications on the topic. This trend indicates a growing interest in the design of cannabis delivery systems. DISCUSSION: The historical importance and therapeutic potential of Cannabis sativa are welldocumented, yet modern medical use remains restricted due to pharmacokinetic limitations. Delivery systems such as extracellular vesicles, microneedles, and emulsions have been developed to improve the bioavailability and stability of cannabinoids. Extracellular vesicles facilitate targeted, noninvasive delivery of cannabinoids to the central nervous system. Microneedles offer a painless method for transdermal administration, overcoming skin barrier limitations. Emulsions improve the solubility and bioavailability of lipophilic cannabinoids, making them suitable for various administration routes. CONCLUSION: Since 2012, there has been considerable growth in patents and publications related to cannabis drug delivery systems, driven by the therapeutic potential of cannabinoids. Innovations in delivery systems like emulsions, microneedles, and extracellular vesicles aim to improve the pharmacokinetics and therapeutic efficacy of cannabis-derived compounds, representing a shift towards medical cannabis applications.\n\nAUTHORS: Ana Sof\u00eda Guerrero Casas, Vanessa Castro Felix Lima, Nicolas Redondo, Izabel Almeida Alves, Diana Marcela Arag\u00f3n\n\nJOURNAL: Mini reviews in medicinal chemistry\n\nPUBLICATION DATE: 2025-05-29\n\nKEYWORDS: Cannabis sativa., Patents, drug delivery, phytocannabinoids\n\nFORMULATION RELEVANCE: 7.3/10\n\nDOI: 10.2174/0113895575343984250519051357\n\nFULL TEXT AVAILABLE: No", "metadata": {"pmid": "40454502", "doi": "10.2174/0113895575343984250519051357", "formulation_relevance": 7.3, "has_full_text": false, "scihub_url": null, "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40454502/"}}

This study evaluated the effects of a lipid-based CBD nanoemulsion in anxiety- and panic-related responses. Male Wistar rats were acutely or chronically orally treated (21\u00a0days) with CBD (2.5 and 5\u00a0mg/kg, 1\u00a0mL/kg) or vehicle (1\u00a0mL/kg) and tested in the avoidance and escape tasks of the elevated T-maze (ETM) and in an open field. We quantified chronic CBD in the whole brain of the animals and evaluated FosB/deltaFosB immunoreactivity (Fos-ir) in non-serotonergic cells of the dorsal raphe (DR) and periaqueductal gray matter and in serotonergic cells of the DR. Acute CBD did not alter behavior. Chronic CBD 2.5\u00a0mg yielded (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SEM) 64.25\u00a0\u00b1\u00a028.82 and CBD 5.0\u00a0mg 21.22\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.46\u00a0ng of CBD/g of brain tissue. Chronic CBD 2.5\u00a0mg induced anxiolytic and panicolytic-like effects. Immunohistochemical results showed that chronic CBD significantly decreased Fos-ir in the lateral and dorsomedial periaqueductal gray and in the dorsal region (DRD) and ventrolateral periqueductal gray/lateral wings (lwDR) of the DR. Fos-ir in the dorsolateral periaqueductal gray was only decreased by CBD 2.5\u00a0mg. CBD increased tryptophan hydroxylase immunoreactivity in the lwDR and DRD. CBD 2.5\u00a0mg also increased tryptophan hydroxylase immunoreactivity in the ventral DR. Additionally, double immunostaining was increased in the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray/lwDR by CBD 2.5\u00a0mg. These results point to the anxiolytic- and panicolytic-like effects of a CBD lipid-based nanoemulsion and suggest that they may be related to the modulation of DR serotonin neurons.\n\nAUTHORS: B\u00e1rbara A Ros\u00e1rio, Maria Paula de Lima, M\u00e1rcio G Vieira, La\u00eds Garret Leite, Pedro E A de Aquino, Glauce S B Viana, Edilberto R Silveira, D\u00e9bora H A de Brito, D\u00e1vila Zampieri, N\u00e1gila Maria P S Ricardo, J\u00e9ssica A Lemes, Adriana M Tucci, Daniel A Ribeiro, Milena B Viana\n\nJOURNAL: Brain research\n\nPUBLICATION DATE: 2025-06-21\n\nKEYWORDS: Anxiety, Cannabidiol, Cannabis sativa, Panic, Serotonin\n\nFORMULATION RELEVANCE: 6.0/10\n\nDOI: 10.1016/j.brainres.2025.149791\n\nFULL TEXT AVAILABLE: No", "metadata": {"pmid": "40550321", "doi": "10.1016/j.brainres.2025.149791", "formulation_relevance": 6.0, "has_full_text": false, "scihub_url": null, "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40550321/"}}

Given its known effects on pain perception, metabolism, and immune modulation, cannabis may influence various aspects of burn treatment, including pain management, wound healing, and rates of infection. This study explores trends in cannabis use among burn patients and evaluates its association with clinical outcomes using the National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB). The NTDB was used to identify burn patients from 2017 to 2021, isolating burn injuries through e-code variables. Cannabis use was documented at admission, and patients without screening data were excluded. The primary exposure variable was cannabis use, with outcomes including mortality, stroke, myocardial infarction, organ failure, timing of surgery, and post-surgical complications. Secondary outcomes included ED vital signs, length of stay, and intensive care needs. Multivariable regression models were applied to analyze the association between cannabis use and outcomes. Of 319\u2009941 burn patients, 52\u2009803 (16.5%) tested positive for cannabis. Cannabis-positive patients were more likely to be male (18% vs. 11%, p<.001) and younger (28.9 vs. 32.6\u00a0years, p<.001). They had higher rates of venothromboembolic events, required longer ICU stays, and were more likely to develop ventilator-associated pneumonia. Additionally, cannabis-positive patients had a higher incidence of organ failure (2.1% vs. 1.3%, p=.012) and reoperations (5.2% vs. 4.1%, p=.019). Cannabis use in burn patients is associated with more complex recoveries, including higher risks of complications. Integrating cannabis screening into burn care protocols and further research is essential to optimize treatment strategies.\n\nAUTHORS: Eloise W Stanton, Artur Manasyan, Maxwell Johnson, Haig A Yenikomshian, T Justin Gillenwater\n\nJOURNAL: Journal of burn care & research : official publication of the American Burn Association\n\nPUBLICATION DATE: 2025-07-16\n\nKEYWORDS: burns, cannabinoids, cannabis, drug use\n\nFORMULATION RELEVANCE: 5.3/10\n\nDOI: 10.1093/jbcr/iraf132\n\nFULL TEXT AVAILABLE: No", "metadata": {"pmid": "40667862", "doi": "10.1093/jbcr/iraf132", "formulation_relevance": 5.3, "has_full_text": false, "scihub_url": null, "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40667862/"}}

The endocannabinoid system (ECS), particularly the type 1 cannabinoid (CB1) receptor, plays a crucial role in NAFLD progression. Cannabinoids, such as cannabidiol (CBD) and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), along with terpenes, such as beta-myrcene and d-limonene, have shown potential therapeutic effects on liver health, particularly in reducing oxidative stress and modulating lipid metabolism. This study aimed to analyse the effects of five cannabis oils (COs), each with different CBD:THC ratios and terpenes content, on hypertension, dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis, oxidative stress, and CB1 receptor expression in an experimental model of NAFLD induced by a sucrose-rich diet (SRD) in Wistar rats for 3 weeks. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were fed either a: (1) reference diet (RD; standard commercial laboratory diet) or a: (2) sucrose-rich diet (SRD) for 3 weeks. 3 to 7 SRD\u2009+\u2009CO as following: (3) SRD\u2009+\u2009THC; (4) SRD\u2009+\u2009CBD; (5) SRD\u2009+\u2009CBD:THC 1:1; (6) SRD\u2009+\u2009CBD:THC 2:1; and (7) SRD\u2009+\u2009CBD:THC 3:1. The COs were administered orally at a dose of 1.5\u00a0mg total cannabinoids/kg body weight daily. The cannabinoid and terpenes content of all COs used in the study was determined. The terpenes found in COs were beta-myrcene, d-limonene, terpinolene, linalool, beta-caryophyllene, alpha-humulene, (-)-guaiol, (-)-alpha-bisabolol. During the experimental period, body weight, food intake and blood pressure were measured. Serum glucose, triglyceride, total cholesterol, uric acid, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (AP) levels were evaluated. Liver tissue histology, NAFLD activity score (NAS), triglyceride and cholesterol content, lipogenic enzyme activities, enzyme related to mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, reactive oxygen species (ROS), thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS), and antioxidant enzyme activities were also evaluated. The CB1 receptor expression was also determined. RESULTS: The results showed that SRD-fed rats developed hypertension, dyslipidemia, liver damage, hepatic steatosis, lipid peroxidation, and oxidative stress. This was accompanied by upregulation of liver CB1 receptor expression. CBD-rich CO, CBD:THC 1:1 ratio CO; CBD:THC 2:1 ratio CO and CBD:THC 3:1 ratio CO showed antihypertensive properties. THC-rich CO, CBD:THC 1:1 ratio CO; CBD:THC 2:1 ratio CO showed the greatest beneficial effects against hepatic steatosis and liver damage. All COs exhibited antioxidant effects in liver tissue. This was associated with normal liver CB1 receptor expression. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that COs, particularly THC-rich CO, CBD:THC ratio 1:1 CO, CBD:THC ratio 2:1 CO and terpenes, can effectively reduce dyslipidemia, liver damage and hepatic steatosis in SRD-induced NAFLD. COs with a higher proportion of CBD in their composition showed antihypertensive properties. All the COs exhibited antioxidant properties. These findings suggest that COs, especially those with CBD:THC ratios of 1:1 and 2:1 and terpenes, may represent a promising therapeutic approach for managing NAFLD and preventing its progression to more severe liver disease.\n\nAUTHORS: Valentina Degrave, Michelle Berenice Vega Joubert, Camila Filippa, Paola Ingaramo, Luc\u00eda Torregiani, Yamile Soledad Caro, Mar\u00eda Mercedes De Zan, Mar\u00eda Eugenia D'Alessandro, Mar\u00eda Eugenia Oliva\n\nJOURNAL: Journal of cannabis research\n\nPUBLICATION DATE: 2025-07-14\n\nKEYWORDS: Cannabinoid, Cannabis oil, Hepatic steatosis, Oxidative stress, Terpenes\n\nFORMULATION RELEVANCE: 5.3/10\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s42238-025-00286-8\n\nFULL TEXT AVAILABLE: No", "metadata": {"pmid": "40660358", "doi": "10.1186/s42238-025-00286-8", "formulation_relevance": 5.3, "has_full_text": false, "scihub_url": null, "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40660358/"}}

Conventional reliance on antibiotics to combat these infections has raised serious concerns regarding antimicrobial resistance, environmental contamination and food safety. Additionally, environmental stressors such as salinity shifts and poor water quality exacerbate disease outbreaks, leading to severe production losses across Asia and Latin America. To explore eco-friendly therapeutic alternatives, this study assessed the antiviral potential of cannabidiol (CBD), a bioactive compound extracted from Cannabis sativa seed oil, identified through GC-MS analysis. Using molecular docking techniques, we evaluated CBD's interactions with key viral proteins: VP28 of WSSV, the tubulin \u03b2-chain of EHP and the capsid protein of IHHNV. The docking results revealed strong binding affinities of -6.61\u2009kcal/mol (EHP), -6.72\u2009kcal/mol (IHHNV) and -5.38\u2009kcal/mol (WSSV), indicating stable and potentially inhibitory interactions. Structural models were retrieved from RCSB PDB and SwissModel, while ligand preparation and docking were performed using AutoDock 4.2. CBD also demonstrated favourable pharmacokinetic and safety profiles, with predictions indicating no mutagenicity, hepatotoxicity or cardiotoxicity, and acceptable drug-likeness characteristics. Compared to other plant-derived compounds previously tested in shrimp disease models, CBD exhibited superior binding stability, more interaction residues and better bioavailability scores. These findings highlight CBD as a promising dual-function agent, capable of both modulating shrimp immunity and directly inhibiting key viral pathogens. These findings highlight cannabidiol (CBD) as a promising dual-action compound, with the potential to both enhance shrimp immune responses and exert direct antiviral effects against key pathogens.

Cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychotropic constituent of cannabis, shows promise in modulating addictive behaviors. This study investigated the effects of chronic CBD administration on alcohol dependence, withdrawal symptoms, and neurodegeneration using two complementary rodent models: chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) exposure, which models established alcohol dependence, and ethanol vapor self-administration (EVSA), which captures the volitional aspects of alcohol intake. In the CIE model, CBD reduced alcohol self-administration during acute withdrawal without affecting alcohol metabolism or locomotor activity. CBD decreased motivation for alcohol, somatic withdrawal signs, withdrawal-induced anxiety-like behaviors, and mechanical sensitivity. During extinction, CBD attenuated alcohol-seeking behavior and stress-induced reinstatement. Electrophysiological recordings revealed that CBD reversed alcohol-induced decreases in neuronal excitability in the basolateral amygdala, suggesting a mechanism involving normalization of neural function. In the EVSA model, CBD reduced voluntary alcohol intake during the escalation phase, impacting voluntary alcohol intake. This effect was specific to alcohol-related behaviors, as it did not affect saccharin self-administration. Immunohistochemical analyses showed that CBD prevented alcohol-induced neurodegeneration in the nucleus accumbens shell and dorsomedial striatum, regions implicated in the volitional control of alcohol consumption. These findings indicate that chronic CBD administration attenuates both behavioral and neurobiological facets of alcohol dependence by modulating neuronal excitability and preventing neurodegeneration, supporting its therapeutic potential for AUD and providing mechanistic insights for future research.\n\nAUTHORS: Selen Dirik, Michelle R Doyle, Courtney P Wood, Paola Campo, Angelica R Martinez, McKenzie Fannon, Maria G Balaguer, Spencer Seely, Bryan A Montoya, Gregory M R Cook, Gabrielle M Palermo, Junjie Lin, Madelyn D Sist, Parsa K Naghshineh, Zihang Lan, Sara R M U Rahman, Raymond Suhandynata, Paul Schweitzer, Marsida Kallupi, Giordano de Guglielmo\n\nJOURNAL: Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology\n\nPUBLICATION DATE: 2025-07-10\n\nKEYWORDS: \n\nFORMULATION RELEVANCE: 5.3/10\n\nDOI: 10.1038/s41386-025-02164-6\n\nFULL TEXT AVAILABLE: No", "metadata": {"pmid": "40640509", "doi": "10.1038/s41386-025-02164-6", "formulation_relevance": 5.3, "has_full_text": false, "scihub_url": null, "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40640509/"}}

Cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive compound from Cannabis sativa, has shown anticancer properties. This review analyzes CBD's therapeutic potential in HCC, focusing on mechanisms, preclinical/clinical findings, and integration into treatment strategies. A systematic search (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar) up to March 2025 identified 16 relevant studies (in vitro, in vivo, clinical). CBD exerts antitumor effects via multiple pathways, including apoptosis, autophagy regulation, metastasis suppression, and tumor microenvironment modulation. CBD interacts with the endocannabinoid system (ECS), inhibits oncogenic signaling (PI3K/AKT/mTOR), and enhances chemotherapeutic efficacy (sorafenib, cabozantinib). Studies show CBD induces pyroptosis via caspase-3/GSDME, and modulates autophagy by inhibiting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. It also sensitizes HCC cells to sorafenib and cabozantinib. Preclinical results are promising, but clinical studies are limited. Challenges like bioavailability and potential hepatotoxicity require investigation. Future research should optimize formulations, determine dosing, and conduct clinical trials to validate CBD's efficacy/safety in HCC patients.

This study profiled specific risks and prevention opportunities across age groups and examined changes in medically significant child cannabis exposures before and after legalization. METHODS: Researchers conducted analyses, including interrupted time-series, to examine 1695 California Poison Control System (CPCS) reports of cannabis exposure in children 0-17 years of age, from 2010-2020. Analyses were confined to moderate and severe exposures, identified by CPCS toxicologists as requiring medical attention. RESULTS: Monthly rates of moderate/severe cannabis exposure per million children increased following legalization (\u03b2=0.06, CI [0.05, 0.08]), especially in children under 5. Fourteen percent required critical care admission. Exposures were primarily unintentional in younger children (87.7-99.2%) and intentional in adolescents (85.5%). Across all ages, most exposures occurred in the home (94.0%) and involved edible products (83.5%). An analysis of packaging on edible brands frequently cited in health records found that most could be easily mistaken for popular candies and snack foods. CONCLUSIONS: Following cannabis legalization in California, reports of child cannabis exposures requiring medical attention increased significantly. Most reported cannabis exposures occurred in the home through the ingestion of edible products, often packaged to look like popular candy and snack food brands. To prevent these harms, cannabis legalization should be accompanied by robust marketing and packaging regulations (e.g., plain labels, larger warning labels). Secondary prevention should focus on educating parents and caregivers on safe cannabis storage in the home.\n\nAUTHORS: Laura A Schmidt, Laurie M Jacobs, Ellicott C Matthay, James Roake, Justin Lewis, Raymond Ho, Dorie E Apollonio\n\nJOURNAL: American journal of preventive medicine\n\nPUBLICATION DATE: 2025-06-30\n\nKEYWORDS: \n\nFORMULATION RELEVANCE: 5.3/10\n\nDOI: 10.1016/j.amepre.2025.107963\n\nFULL TEXT AVAILABLE: No", "metadata": {"pmid": "40602693", "doi": "10.1016/j.amepre.2025.107963", "formulation_relevance": 5.3, "has_full_text": false, "scihub_url": null, "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40602693/"}}

CBD modulates immune responses, including the regulation of T cell activity, induction of macrophage apoptosis, suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and modulation of signaling pathways involved in inflammation and immune homeostasis. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases to identify relevant preclinical and clinical studies on CBD's immunomodulatory effects. Preclinical and clinical studies demonstrate its efficacy in treating autoimmune diseases such as Type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease, along with its potential in neuropathic pain and cancer therapy. Recent advancements in nanotechnology-based delivery systems have further enhanced CBD's therapeutic potential by improving its solubility, bioavailability, and targeted delivery, enabling innovative approaches for wound healing, inflammation management, and cancer treatment. However, challenges such as variability in immune responses, limited long-term safety data, and potential drug-drug interactions persist. This review comprehensively examines CBD's pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and immunomodulatory mechanisms, highlighting its clinical potential, existing limitations, and future directions in advancing its integration into precision medicine and immune regulation.\n\nAUTHORS: Khizra Mujahid, Muhammad Shahzaib Rasheed, Azka Sabir, Jutaek Nam, Talha Ramzan, Waseem Ashraf, Imran Imran\n\nJOURNAL: Saudi pharmaceutical journal : SPJ : the official publication of the Saudi Pharmaceutical Society\n\nPUBLICATION DATE: 2025-05-23\n\nKEYWORDS: Autoimmune diseases, Cannabidiol, Immune cells, Immune modulation, Pharmacodynamics, Pharmacokinetics\n\nFORMULATION RELEVANCE: 5.1/10\n\nDOI: 10.1007/s44446-025-00005-7\n\nFULL TEXT AVAILABLE: No", "metadata": {"pmid": "40407987", "doi": "10.1007/s44446-025-00005-7", "formulation_relevance": 5.1, "has_full_text": false, "scihub_url": null, "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40407987/"}}
