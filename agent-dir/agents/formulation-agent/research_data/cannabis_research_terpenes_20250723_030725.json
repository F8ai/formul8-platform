    "abstract": "Inhibition of melanogenesis is of major interest in the cosmetic industry. The mechanism underlying melanogenesis includes regulating tyrosinase by activating various signaling pathways, such as protein kinase A and C pathways. Natural material-based agents have recently gained attention as alternative medicines to suppress melanogenic pathways. Cannabis sativa contains many bioactive compounds that are widely used in traditional herbal medicines. The aim of this study was to identify and assess the anti-melanogenic effect of terpene extract from Cannabis sativa flower (TCF) to explore novel depigmenting agents. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed that TCF contains five monoterpenes, eleven sesquiterpenes, and a diterpene. MTT and melanin content assays demonstrated that TCF significantly decreased the melanin content per live cell in a dose-dependent manner. Tyrosinase inhibition assay showed that TCF exhibited little inhibitory effect on tyrosinase at an equal dose, which reduced the melanin content. However, western blot analysis revealed that TCF downregulated microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), and tyrosinase-related proteins TRP1, and TRP2 expression by suppressing PKC, p38, and ERK/STAT3, while upregulated Akt pathway in melan-a. These results highlight the potential application of TCF as a natural whitening agent in the cosmetics industry.",

    "title": "Effects of five cannabis oils with different CBD: THC ratios and terpenes on hypertension, dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis, oxidative stress, and CB1 receptor in an experimental model.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common liver disorder caused by oxidative stress and dysregulation of lipid metabolism. The endocannabinoid system (ECS), particularly the type 1 cannabinoid (CB1) receptor, plays a crucial role in NAFLD progression. Cannabinoids, such as cannabidiol (CBD) and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), along with terpenes, such as beta-myrcene and d-limonene, have shown potential therapeutic effects on liver health, particularly in reducing oxidative stress and modulating lipid metabolism. This study aimed to analyse the effects of five cannabis oils (COs), each with different CBD:THC ratios and terpenes content, on hypertension, dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis, oxidative stress, and CB1 receptor expression in an experimental model of NAFLD induced by a sucrose-rich diet (SRD) in Wistar rats for 3 weeks. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were fed either a: (1) reference diet (RD; standard commercial laboratory diet) or a: (2) sucrose-rich diet (SRD) for 3 weeks. 3 to 7 SRD\u2009+\u2009CO as following: (3) SRD\u2009+\u2009THC; (4) SRD\u2009+\u2009CBD; (5) SRD\u2009+\u2009CBD:THC 1:1; (6) SRD\u2009+\u2009CBD:THC 2:1; and (7) SRD\u2009+\u2009CBD:THC 3:1. The COs were administered orally at a dose of 1.5\u00a0mg total cannabinoids/kg body weight daily. The cannabinoid and terpenes content of all COs used in the study was determined. The terpenes found in COs were beta-myrcene, d-limonene, terpinolene, linalool, beta-caryophyllene, alpha-humulene, (-)-guaiol, (-)-alpha-bisabolol. During the experimental period, body weight, food intake and blood pressure were measured. Serum glucose, triglyceride, total cholesterol, uric acid, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (AP) levels were evaluated. Liver tissue histology, NAFLD activity score (NAS), triglyceride and cholesterol content, lipogenic enzyme activities, enzyme related to mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, reactive oxygen species (ROS), thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS), and antioxidant enzyme activities were also evaluated. The CB1 receptor expression was also determined. RESULTS: The results showed that SRD-fed rats developed hypertension, dyslipidemia, liver damage, hepatic steatosis, lipid peroxidation, and oxidative stress. This was accompanied by upregulation of liver CB1 receptor expression. CBD-rich CO, CBD:THC 1:1 ratio CO; CBD:THC 2:1 ratio CO and CBD:THC 3:1 ratio CO showed antihypertensive properties. THC-rich CO, CBD:THC 1:1 ratio CO; CBD:THC 2:1 ratio CO showed the greatest beneficial effects against hepatic steatosis and liver damage. All COs exhibited antioxidant effects in liver tissue. This was associated with normal liver CB1 receptor expression. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that COs, particularly THC-rich CO, CBD:THC ratio 1:1 CO, CBD:THC ratio 2:1 CO and terpenes, can effectively reduce dyslipidemia, liver damage and hepatic steatosis in SRD-induced NAFLD. COs with a higher proportion of CBD in their composition showed antihypertensive properties. All the COs exhibited antioxidant properties. These findings suggest that COs, especially those with CBD:THC ratios of 1:1 and 2:1 and terpenes, may represent a promising therapeutic approach for managing NAFLD and preventing its progression to more severe liver disease.",

    "abstract": "Terpenes are the largest and most diverse class of natural products, essential for plant defence, ecological interactions, and environmental adaptation. Cannabis sativa is noted for its rich terpene profile, influencing aroma, flavour, and pharmacological properties. Limonene, a significant monoterpene, is commercially important in the fragrance and flavouring industries, making it a target for metabolic engineering. Terpene biosynthesis involves terpene synthase enzymes that convert isoprenoid diphosphates into diverse terpene scaffolds. Despite advances in terpene biochemistry, C. sativa TPSs lack structural characterisation. This study presents the first crystal structure of (-)-limonene synthase from C. sativa, offering insights into monoterpene biosynthesis. Solved at 3.2\u00a0\u00c5 resolution, the structure shows an \"open\" conformation with a solvent-accessible active site and disordered loops near the catalytic pocket, indicating a pre-catalytic state that aids substrate access. Biochemical characterisation confirmed limonene synthase as a highly specific monoterpene synthase, predominantly producing (-)-limonene from geranyl diphosphate with minor amounts of eight other monoterpenes.

    "abstract": "Cannabis sativa L. constituents, such as cannabinoids, terpenes, flavonoids, and other secondary metabolites, determine the plant's (medicinal) effects and properties in a complex interplay, a phenomenon known as the entourage effect. However, environmental influences like cultivation method, soil, light, and climate might also influence the plant's chemical composition-and thus its therapeutic profile. Much like in viticulture, the concept of a \"cannabis terroir\" might play an important role in determining the plant's chemical phenotype. The aim of this study was therefore to make these complex properties analytically accessible and develop a comprehensive metabolomics workflow using gas chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (GC-HRMS) and liquid chromatography-high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS/MS) in positive and negative ionization mode, applying HILIC and reversed phase chromatography to assess multiple chemical classes. Data processing and statistical analysis were done in MS-DIAL and MetaboAnalyst, respectively. The method was applied to 35 CBD-type cannabis flowers grown under different environmental conditions, and compounds belonging to various chemical classes were successfully detected. Principal component analysis revealed distinct clustering of the samples, and key discriminative features were identified, including cannabinoids, terpenes such as \u03b2-caryophyllene and \u03b1-humulene, cuticular alkanes (e.g., pentacosane and nonacosane), and polar compounds such as choline and trigonelline. The markers enabled a discrimination of samples not only by chemical phenotype but also by cultivation environment, supporting the emerging concept of a cannabis terroir. In conclusion, this study introduces an analytical framework for the comprehensive chemical profiling of cannabis employing GC-HRMS and LC-HRMS analysis and advanced statistical techniques.",

METHODS: Eleven female participants (5-16\u2009years) with a pathogenic variant in the MECP2 gene were recruited to this study, receiving NTI164 twice daily for 12\u2009weeks. The primary outcome measure was the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) Scale, with secondary outcomes measured using the CGI-Severity (CGI-S), RTT Behaviour Questionnaire (RSBQ), RTT-Symptom Index Score (RTT-SIS), RTT-Domain-Specific Concerns-Visual-Analog Scale (RTT-DSC-VAS), Impact of Childhood Neurological Disability/Quality of Life (ICND+QoL), and RTT-Caregiver Burden Inventory (RTT-CBI). Paired-samples t-test was used to assess significance between baseline and Week 12. RESULTS: Improvements were seen in the total CGI-I score (p\u2009=\u20090.028), with improvements in communication skills (p\u2009=\u20090.003), mental alertness (p\u2009=\u20090.033), socialisation/eye contact (p\u2009=\u20090.0004), attentiveness (p\u2009=\u20090.001), and anxiety (p\u2009=\u20090.004). CGI-S also demonstrated better outcomes after NTI164 administration (p\u2009=\u20090.008). RSBQ showed improvements in total score (p\u2009=\u20090.0005), general mood (p\u2009=\u20090.0003), breathing problems (p\u2009=\u20090.041), repetitive face movements (p\u2009=\u20090.004), and fear/anxiety (p\u2009=\u20090.006). RTT-DSC-VAS showed positive developments in abilities to communicate choices (p\u2009=\u20090.041). ICND total score was improved (p\u2009=\u20090.003), as well as cognition (p\u2009=\u20090.027) and Quality of Life (p\u2009=\u20090.0002). Total score on the RTT-CBI was improved (p\u2009=\u20090.006). CONCLUSION: NTI164 demonstrated safety and improved some clinical and functional outcomes in RTT. These improvements justify ongoing research into NTI164, which may be a potential adjunct therapy in RTT.",

    "abstract": "Cannabis sativa is a high-value plant renowned for its diverse chemical composition and abundant terpene content, contributing to its unique aroma, flavour, and therapeutic effects. Terpenes significantly influence consumer preference for C. sativa products, driving scientific interest in optimising terpene expression profiles and shaping the selective breeding of terpene profiles in C. sativa cultivars. In particular, the monoterpene, terpinolene, is influential in defining the sensory and therapeutic qualities of many C. sativa strains due to its woody, citrus-like aroma. Here we report the 2.5 \u00c5 resolution crystal structure of terpinolene synthase (CsTOS) from C. sativa in its apo form. The structure exhibits the class I monoterpene synthase fold with an open active site conformation. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we identified H618 as a key residues in determining product specificity. Substituting H618 with charged residues resulted in the preferential formation of limonene over terpinolene, highlighting its critical role in stabilising the substrate intermediate. Additionally, novel mutations uncovered an extended epistatic network of residues within 5 \u00c5 of the active site, spanning the \u03b1-helical bundle of the terpene synthase fold. These interactions contribute to monoterpene formation by modulating substrate positioning and catalytic activity. These insights advance our understanding of monoterpene biosynthesis and enable the targeted engineering of terpene synthases for customised terpene production, offering significant potential for the C. sativa industry.",

    "title": "Cannabis concentrate vaping chemistry.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This review article addresses the vaping chemistry of manufactured cannabis concentrates-a topic that remains under-researched despite the widespread availability and growing popularity of these products. Given their current prevalence and the fact that many of the findings discussed herein are from early-stage investigations, further research is essential to fully assess the public health risks associated with concentrate use. The purpose of this article is to help begin to bridge this knowledge gap by outlining the technical challenges of studying cannabis concentrates and to present evidence-based data concerning toxicant exposures as a foundation for future investigations. METHODS: A search of cannabis concentrate vaping within the date range of 2019-2025 on Google Scholar returned approximately 2,700 hits. A cannabis concentrate was defined as a sample containing at least 50% (w/w) cannabinoids. In addition to our group's articles, the search results contained six manuscripts that described at least a partial focus on molecular emissions specifically derived from vaping or dabbing samples that included cannabis concentrates. FINDINGS: Studying cannabis concentrate vaping poses distinct technical challenges that differ from those associated with electronic nicotine delivery systems. Emissions from vaping concentrates contain a substantial proportion of harmful aerosol toxicants, including isoprene, 3-methylcrotonaldehyde, 3-methyl-1-butene, and 2-methyl-2-butene. Moreover, some concentrate formulations have contained hazardous additives such as pine rosin and ketene precursors such as cannabinoid acetates. As with nicotine vaping, the presence of oxygen plays a critical role in driving the formation of many toxic chemical degradation products during vaping. CONCLUSION: Since the legalization of recreational cannabis, concentrates have become one of the most rapidly expanding segments of the U.S. cannabis market. However, research into the specific health risks of vaping these products has significantly lagged their widespread use. The studies presented in this review article highlight the potential for exposure to known toxicants during the vaping of cannabis concentrates.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Triterpenoid compounds such as betulinic acid (BA) and oleanolic acid (OA) exhibit considerable pharmacological activities. However, their current production primarily relies on plant extraction and chemical synthesis, methods that are often plagued by low efficiency, complex extraction processes, and environmental concerns. Microbial-based synthesis has emerged as one of the most effective approaches for producing BA and OA. RESULTS: This study presented the first identification of filamentous fungal strains efficiently synthesizing both BA and OA. The strain ZBS49 is a newly identified species of Clonostachys isolated from Gleditsia japonica Miq. (showing 99.82% sequence identity), produced 47.7\u00a0mg/L of BA. The strain XJ1-1, characterized as Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and isolated from Cannabis sativa L., yielded 65.76\u00a0mg/L of OA. After optimizing the culture medium and cultivation conditions, the yields of ZBS49 and XJ1-1 increased to 288.97 and 86.14\u00a0mg/L, representing improvements of 506% and 31%, respectively. Furthermore, we discovered that the BA extract of the ZBS49 strain significantly inhibited hepatocellular cancer cells (SMMC-7721 and HepG2) in a dose-dependent manner, with a minimum inhibitory concentration of 70 \u00b5M. Genomic analysis of Clonostachys sp. ZBS49 elucidated that the presence of 16 putative genes was related to triterpenoid biosynthesis and 6 distinct terpene biosynthetic gene clusters. Among the 145 CYP450, 5 genes involved in C-28 oxidation were predicted. CONCLUSIONS: This research underscores the effectiveness of filamentous fungi as a biotechnological platform for the efficient production of BA and its derivatives, highlighting their potential applications in cancer therapy. Furthermore, these findings provide valuable genetic resources and establish a robust technical and theoretical framework for utilizing ZBS49 as a microbial platform for the biosynthesis of triterpenoids.",

    "abstract": "Light supplementation within the canopy is an effective method to improve light distribution throughout the whole plant, ensuring the inner canopies receive adequate light exposure to maximize overall growth. This approach is gaining interest among cannabis growers looking for more efficient lighting strategies to enhance their valuable production for medicinal purposes. We compared the traditional top lighting (TL) approach with two light supplementation methods: subcanopy lighting (SCL), which adds extra light to the inner canopies from below, and inter-canopy lighting (ICL), providing dedicated light at the basal and middle levels. Both SCL and ICL resulted in a more uniform light distribution throughout the plants and increased the yields of inflorescences, cannabinoids, and terpenes. The ICL treatment achieved the highest yield increases, showing a 29.95% increase in dry inflorescence yield, a 24.4% higher accumulation of THC, and a 12.5% increase in total terpene concentration. Notably, both SCL and ICL reduced the coefficients of variation, yielding more standardized products by decreasing the variability of the dry inflorescences yield, which also had more consistent chemical profiles, with reductions in variability for both THC and total terpene yields of over 50%. Although using more energy for lighting, SCL was more power-efficient for inflorescence and cannabinoid yields, while ICL was more efficient in achieving yield enhancements. In conclusion, adding supplemental light to the inner canopies enhances the profitability of medical cannabis cultivation, resulting in higher yields, improved energy efficiency, and more standardized products for research and medical purposes.",

    "abstract": "Epilepsy is a widespread neurological disorder that remains a critical global public health challenge. While numerous antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are available, many patients either fail to achieve adequate seizure control or experience significant side effects. One promising alternative is pure cannabidiol (CBD), but using a whole cannabis extract may be equally effective and preferred for some patients. In the current study, we employed the pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced hyperactivity model in zebrafish to compare the effects of CBD with various cannabis extracts. We evaluated three cannabis strains, each subjected to three different extraction methods, and benchmarked the results against the commercially available AED valproic acid (VPA). Our findings revealed that 5.7 \u00b5g/mL of CBD and 10 \u00b5g/mL of different extracts significantly reduced movement compared to PTZ and VPA. In addition, effective extracts produced effects similar to pure CBD despite containing much lower molecule levels. These results reinforced and expanded previous evidence supporting the clinical potential of both CBD and whole cannabis extracts for seizure control while suggesting a possible entourage effect. Further research is necessary to determine which patients may benefit more from pure CBD versus those who might prefer whole cannabis extracts.",

    "abstract": "Cannabis sativa is a medicinally and economically significant plant known for its production of cannabinoids, terpenoids, and other secondary metabolites. This study presents a transcriptomic analysis to elucidate tissue-specific expression and regulatory mechanisms across leaves, stems, and roots. A total of 2,530 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, with key genes such as terpene synthase (TPS) and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) exhibiting elevated expression in leaf tissues, emphasizing their roles in terpenoid and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. Alternative splicing (AS) analysis revealed 8,729 distinct events, dominated by exon skipping, contributing to transcriptomic diversity. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) prediction identified 3,245 candidates, many of which displayed tissue-specific expression patterns and co-expression with metabolic genes, suggesting regulatory roles in secondary metabolism. Additionally, 12,314 SNPs and 2,786 INDELs were detected, with notable enrichment in genes associated with secondary metabolite biosynthesis, particularly in leaf tissues. These findings advance the understanding of molecular mechanisms governing secondary metabolism and genetic diversity in C. sativa, providing valuable insights for future metabolic engineering and breeding strategies to enhance cannabinoid production.",

    "abstract": "Cannabinoids and terpenes, key bioactive components of cannabis, are increasingly studied for their individual and combined contributions to the therapeutic potential of cannabis-based treatments, with ongoing research exploring their distinct and interactive effects. This study aimed to encapsulate cannabigerolic acid (CBGA) in poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles (PEG-PLGA NPs) and investigate the effects of combining CBGA NPs with cannabis-derived terpene-loaded NPs (myrcene [MC], nerolidol [NL], and caryophyllene [CPh]) for potential applications in pain management. CBGA NPs (152\u00a0nm) and terpene-loaded NPs (233-297\u00a0nm) were prepared via nanoprecipitation and emulsion-solvent evaporation, respectively, exhibiting a polydispersity index\u00a0<\u00a00.3 and negative zeta potentials (-23 to -26\u00a0mV). Encapsulation efficiency was 98.6\u00a0% for CBGA and 13-33\u00a0% for terpenes. CBGA release followed a biphasic profile, with\u00a0\u223c\u00a020\u00a0% released within 4\u00a0h and sustained release over 72\u00a0h. In vitro evaluation used HEK293 cells expressing the nociceptive transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1) channel, a key mediator of pain perception. TRPV1 activation was assessed via calcium influx kinetics (Fluo-4 indicator). The EC50 values were 23.8\u00a0\u00b5g/mL (CBGA NPs), 8.0\u00a0\u00b5g/mL (MC NPs), 6.7\u00a0\u00b5g/mL (NL NPs), and 13.3\u00a0\u00b5g/mL (CPh NPs). Combinatorial treatments of CBGA NPs with terpene NPs at their respective EC50 concentrations revealed significantly enhanced calcium influx compared to individual NPs, with the strongest interaction observed for CBGA/NL and moderate effects for CBGA/MC. Fluorescence imaging further corroborated these findings. These results suggest that combining CBGA NPs with terpene-loaded NPs could potentiate pain-relief efficacy, offering a promising strategy for advanced therapeutic formulations.",

The effects of solvent type, temperature, time, and pressure were evaluated using five organic solvents and two binary solvent systems. Cannabinoid profiles of obtained extracts were analyzed using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS), while terpene profiles were characterized through solid-phase microextraction (SPME) combined with GC-MS. Next, two selected extracts with the highest content of cannabinoid and terpene fractions (Futu1 and Futu2) were tested for antiproliferative activity toward cancer cell lines (MV4-11, AGS, HT-29, MDA-MB-468, MCF-7) and their cytotoxicity was evaluated on non-tumorigenic MCF-10A cells. Extract Futu1 contained 51.57% cannabinoids, 9.8% monoterpenes, and 90.2% sesquiterpenes in the terpene fraction. Futu2 exhibited a higher proportion of monoterpenes in the terpene fraction (19.6% monoterpenes and 80.4% sesquiterpenes) and consisted of 49.49% cannabinoids. Both extracts exhibited higher selectivity for cancer cells over non-tumorigenic cells, with Futu2 demonstrating stronger antiproliferative properties. Interestingly, lower concentrations of extracts and tested free, single cannabinoids stimulated the growth of leukemia (MV4-11) and breast cancer (MDA-MB-468) cell lines while their higher concentrations suppressed proliferation.",

    "abstract": "The need for nonaddictive and effective treatments for chronic pain are at an all-time high. Historical precedence, and now clinical evidence, supports the use of cannabis for alleviating chronic pain. A plethora of research on delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol exists, yet cannabis is comprised of a multitude of constituents, some of which possess analgesic potential, that have not been systematically investigated, including the terpene myrcene. Myrcene attenuates pain hypersensitivity in preclinical models and is one of the most abundant terpenes found in cannabis. Despite these findings, it remains unclear how myrcene elicits these effects on nociceptive systems. The present study uses a male and female mouse model of neuropathic pain as well as in vitro experiments with HEK293T cells to explore these questions. We first demonstrate myrcene (1-200 mg/kg i.p.) dose-dependently increases mechanical nociceptive thresholds, where potency was greater in female compared with male pain mice. Testing canonical tetrad outcomes, mice were tested for hypolocomotion and hypothermia after myrcene administration. Myrcene did not alter locomotion or temperature, but female pain mice showed a conditioned place aversion to myrcene. A cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) antagonist inhibited myrcene's anti-allodynia. By contrast, in vitro cell culture experiments using a TRUPATH assay revealed myrcene does not directly activate CB1 receptors nor alter CB1 receptor activity elicited by CB1 agonist (CP 55,940) or endocannabinoids (anandamide or 2-arachidonoylglycerol). Understanding engagement of CB1 receptors in pain modulation and myrcene's mechanism of action warrants further study to understand the diversity of cannabis pharmacology and to further the frontier of pain research.",

    "title": "A Validated GC-MS Method for Major Terpenes Quantification in Hydrodistilled Cannabis sativa Essential oil.",
    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Terpenes, which are found in high concentrations in the essential oil fraction of the Cannabis sativa flower, have demonstrated potential in many therapeutic and industrial applications. OBJECTIVES: This work reports on a method developed for quantifying 18 terpenes in C. sativa essential oil obtained through hydrodistillation. The following method has been evaluated for specificity, selectivity, accuracy, linearity, precision, stability, limit of detection, and limit of quantification. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Samples were prepared by separating the essential oil fraction through hydrodistillation and then diluting with ethyl acetate containing a 100\u2009\u03bcg/mL solution of n-tridecane and octadecane as internal standards. Analysis was performed on a gas chromatograph mass spectrometer (GCMS) using selected ion monitoring (SIM). RESULTS: The developed method enabled quantification of isomers of nerolidol and ocimene and several coeluting compounds, with recoveries of 87.35%-116.61%. Two cultivars of C. sativa flower were evaluated, and the dominant terpene compounds in both cultivars were \u03b2-myrcene (5.85-8.62\u2009mg/g dried plant) and \u03b2-caryophyllene (3.89-4.69\u2009mg/g), followed by \u03b1-humulene (1.35-1.99\u2009mg/g), limonene (0.91-1.33\u2009mg/g), and \u03b1-bisabolol (0.66-0.68\u2009mg/g). CONCLUSION: This method provides an accurate and reliable procedure for separating and quantifying the major terpene compounds in C. sativa flower using hydrodistillation and GCMS with SIM. The simplicity and solvent-free nature of the hydrodistillation extraction, combined with the specificity and accuracy of using SIM and external standards, enables the determination of total and individual terpenes concentrations within plant material and supports numerous industrial and therapeutic applications.",

    "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Cannabis sativa has been widely used in traditional medicine for its therapeutic properties. However, in Morocco, the ethnobotanical applications of Cannabis sativa, especially its essential oils, are underexplored. This study investigates, for the first time, the effects of Moroccan Cannabis sativa essential oil on peripheral neuropathic pain. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Peripheral neuropathic pain was induced in mice through sciatic nerve injury. The mice were treated daily with cannabis essential oil for 21 days. Behavioral tests were conducted on days 1, 7, 14, and 21 to evaluate thermal, mechanical, and cold sensitivity. The essential oil's chemical composition was analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS). RESULTS: The main constituents of the essential oil were (E)-caryophyllene (41.59%) and \u03b1-humulene (14%). Daily treatment with the essential oil significantly reduced pain sensitivity and improved functional and histological recovery over time. These effects are linked to the activity of the dominant terpenoids in the oil. CONCLUSION: Moroccan Cannabis sativa essential oil shows significant therapeutic potential for managing peripheral neuropathic pain. By enhancing recovery and alleviating pain symptoms, it offers a promising alternative for treating chronic pain caused by nerve injuries.",

    "title": "Entourage effects of nonpsychotropic cannabinoids on visceral sensitivity in experimental colitis.",
    "abstract": "Abdominal pain is the most disabling symptom of inflammatory bowel diseases, but current treatments are limited, leading patients to seek alternatives such as cannabis. Cannabis contains over 100 cannabinoids which, unlike tetrahydrocannabinol, are biologically active compounds often without psychotropic effects (ie, nonpsychotropic cannabinoids [npCBs]). These npCBs have analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties and may show potentiating effects when administered in combination, referred to as the entourage effect. Here, we investigated the analgesic effects of cannabichromene, cannabidiol (CBD), cannabidivarin, and cannabigerol (CBG), individually and in combination, using the mouse model of dextran sulfate sodium colitis-induced visceral hypersensitivity (VHS). We then explored antinociceptive targets through patch-clamp electrophysiology on dorsal root ganglia neurons and recombinant channels. We found that a single injection of 10 mg/kg of either CBD or CBG reduced both VHS and c-Fos activation in the spinal dorsal horn. Moreover, a combination of npCBs consisting of 5 mg/kg CBD with 1 mg/kg of cannabichromene, cannabidivarin, and CBG-all at subtherapeutic dosages-reduced VHS, without altering colitis. Electrophysiological recordings revealed that the antinociceptive mixture of npCBs acts through voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels, particularly Cav2.2, but not Cav3.2 and Kv channels. These results suggest that CBD, CBG, and a mixture of npCBs given at subtherapeutic doses may be beneficial in managing VHS associated with inflammatory bowel disease. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Cannabis is increasingly used as an alternative treatment for managing pain associated with chronic conditions. Nonpsychotropic cannabinoids, such as cannabidiol, interact with ionotropic and voltage-gated ion channels. In our study, we demonstrated that cannabidiol, cannabigerol, and a combination of nonpsychotropic cannabinoids, administered at subtherapeutic doses, effectively alleviated visceral hypersensitivity associated with inflammatory bowel disease.",

    "abstract": "Cannabis sativa L. is an important medicinal plant with high commercial value. In recent years, the research interest in cannabidiol (CBD) and terpene-rich cannabis has been rapidly expanding due to their high therapeutic potential. The present study aims to explore the phytocannabinoids and terpenes diversity in C. sativa collected from different parts of northern India. Our findings revealed that the cannabinoids and terpenes synthesize together in capitate stalked and capitate sessile glandular trichomes, whereas bulbous glands synthesize only terpenes. The North Indian C. sativa is mainly dominated by tetrahydrocannabinol. The CBD-rich plant diversity is nominal (1.11%) in studied north Indian C. sativa. The essential oil profiling reveals (E)-caryophyllene (10.30%-36.80%) as the major constituent, followed by \u03b1-humulene (0.50%-15.29%) and \u03b1-bisabolol (0.00%-16.40%) in the North Indian population. The cannabinoids and terpenes content showed significant diversity among and within the five studied populations. The correlation analysis between cannabinoids and terpenes indicates that \u03b1-pinene, \u03b2-pinene and limonene positively correlated with CBD content. Similarly, \u03b1- and \u03b2-selinene correlate positively with tetrahydrocannabinolic acid content. This study could help to identify the key cultivars from India and establish a consistent chemotype for future breeding programs.",

However, the contribution of these terpenes in anxiety, at relevant levels and exposure methods common with cannabis use, is lacking empirical assessment. We tested the anxiolytic properties of two prominent cannabis terpenes, linalool and \u03b2-myrcene, in male and female mice using short duration vapor pulls to model human inhalation when combusting flower or vaping cannabis oil. We observed sex differences in the locomotor effects in the open field and anxiolytic properties in the elevated plus maze of these terpenes that depended on their exposure characteristics. Both linalool and \u03b2-myrcene had anxiolytic effects in female mice when delivered in discrete vapor pulls over the course of 30 min. In male mice, only a single vapor hit containing linalool or \u03b2-myrcene had anxiolytic effects. The combination of sub-effective levels of linalool and the phytocannabinoid, cannabidiol (CBD), had synergistic anxiolytic effects in females, but these entourage effects between CBD and terpenes were absent with \u03b2-myrcene for females and for either terpene in males. Together, our findings reveal sex differences in the anxiolytic properties of common cannabis terpenes and highlight the potential benefits of unique combinations of CBD and terpenes in expanding the therapeutic dose window.",

    "abstract": "Cannabis flower scent is one of the key characteristics of the cannabis plant. The diverse scents impact user experiences and offer medicinal benefits. These scents originate from volatile compounds, particularly terpenes and terpenoids. This study characterized the volatile profile of 19 different dried cannabis flowers using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry coupled with headspace-solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME-GC-MS). A total of 75 compounds were identified, including alcohols, aldehydes, benzenes, esters, ketone, monoterpenes, monoterpenoids, sesquiterpenes, and sesquiterpenoids. Cluster analysis was able to group the 19 cannabis cultivars into five clusters based on volatile chemotypes using chemometric techniques of hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and principal component analysis (PCA). Potential discriminant markers of each cultivar were then analyzed using a supervised partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) verified through Variable Importance in Projection values (VIP), identifying twenty discriminant markers. In addition, the correlations among 75 volatile compounds were also obtained. The findings of this study provide a valuable database of single cannabis cultivars, useful for identifying individual strains and verifying their quality. Clustering the cultivars by volatile chemotype can be used for the classification of cannabis in the market. The results of this study are expected to be a starting point for further cannabis breeding programs to expand knowledge of this plant. Furthermore, the proposed method is applicable to other aroma plants in the future.",

This study aimed to identify VOC markers to distinguish between higher CBD and THC cannabis cultivars under field conditions. Among the 58 VOCs, \u03b2-caryophyllene and \u03b1-humulene were primary VOCs across all cannabis cultivars. Intriguingly, certain terpene VOCs exhibited contrasting trends between higher CBD and higher THC cannabis cultivars. Eudesma-3,7(11)-diene and \u03b1-guaiol consistently appeared as highlighted compounds, suggesting their potential to distinguish between higher CBD and THC cannabis cultivars. ROC curve analysis revealed approximately 94% predictive accuracy for these putative markers.

    "abstract": "Terpenes, volatile compounds known for their aromatic and therapeutic properties, play a pivotal role in shaping the overall chemical profile of Cannabis sativa L. Their biosynthesis in planta occurs in trichomes and involves the 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) and the mevalonic acid (MVA) pathways, responsible for producing the substrates utilized by a family of enzymes, the terpene synthases (TPS), for terpene production. In this work, a comprehensive approach combining chemical analyses of the volatile compounds characterizing the aroma of the inflorescences three C. sativa genotypes collected at three stages of maturity and the transcriptional analyses of key genes involved in the terpene biosynthesis was adopted to study this pathway. The results revealed different terpene profiles among genotypes, which were characterized by peculiar compounds belonging to the sesqui- (CINBOL and Fibrante) or monoterpene (Ermo) categories. Both structural and putative regulatory genes were analysed by RT-qPCR, revealing distinct transcriptional profiles of Terpene Synthases, contributing to the diversity of mono and sesquiterpenes synthesized. Furthermore, the research delved into potential regulatory genes associated with trichome formation, a crucial factor influencing terpene accumulation. This integrated approach highlighted complex mechanisms governing terpene accumulation in cannabis, while also offering potential regulators putatively involved in this pathway.",

    "abstract": "Cannabis terpenes and terpenoids are among the major classes of pharmacologically active secondary metabolites of therapeutic interest. Indeed, these hydrocarbon molecules, responsible for the characteristic aroma of cannabis flowers, are thought to be involved in a synergistic effect known as the \"entourage effect\", together with cannabinoids. Numerous analytical studies have been carried out to characterize the terpene and terpenoid contents of some cannabis varieties, but they have not proposed any real quantification or have described a limited number of analytical standards or average response factors, which may have led to over- or underestimation of the real content of the cannabis flowers. Real and reliable quantification is necessary to justify the entourage effect. Here, we report a rigorous and precise GC-FID and GC-MS method for the identification and quantification of cannabis terpenes and terpenoids. This method is distinguished by the use of a high number of analytical standards, the determination of retention indices for all compounds studied, an exhaustive comparison of databases and scientific literature, the use of relevant response factors, and internal calibration for reliable results. It was applied to the study of terpenic compounds in five commercial varieties of medicinal cannabis produced by Bedrocan International: a CBD-rich (Bedrolite\u00ae), a THC/CBD balanced (Bediol\u00ae), and three THC-dominant (Bedrocan\u00ae, Bedica\u00ae and Bedrobinol\u00ae). Two extraction solvents are described (ethanol and hexane) to compare their selectivity towards target molecules, and to describe as exhaustively as possible the terpenic profile of the five pharmaceutical-grade varieties. Twenty-three standards were used for accurate dosages. This work highlights that the choice of solvent and the analysis method reliability are critical for the study of these terpenic compounds, regarding their contribution to the entourage effect.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Cannabis sativa L. inflorescences are rich in cannabinoids and terpenes. Traditional chemical analysis methods for cannabinoids and terpenes, such as liquid and gas chromatography (using UV or MS detectors), are expensive and time-consuming. OBJECTIVES: This study explores the use of Fourier transform near-infrared (FT-NIR) spectroscopy combined with chemometric approaches for classifying cannabis chemovars and predicting cannabinoid and terpene concentrations for the first time in freshly harvested (wet) cannabis inflorescence. The study also compares the performance of FT-NIR spectroscopy on wet versus dry cannabis inflorescences. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Spectral data from 187 samples across seven cannabis chemovars were analyzed using partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and partial least squares-regression (PLS-R) models. RESULTS: The PLS-DA models effectively classified chemovars and major classes using only two latent variables (LVs) with minimal overfitting risk, with sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy values approaching 1. Despite the high water content in wet cannabis inflorescence, the PLS-R models demonstrated good to excellent predictive capabilities for nine cannabinoids and eight terpenes using FT-NIR spectra for the first time, achieving cross-validation and prediction R-squared values greater than 0.7, ratio of performance to interquartile range (RPIQ) exceeding 2, and a RMSECV/RMSEC ratio below 1.24. However, the low-cannabidiolic acid submodel and (-)-\u03949-trans-tetrahydrocannabinol model showed poor predictive performance. Some cannabinoid and terpene prediction models in wet cannabis inflorescence exhibited lower predictive capabilities compared with previously published models for dry cannabis inflorescence. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that FT-NIR spectroscopy can be a viable rapid on-site analytical tool for growers during the inflorescence flowering stage.",

    "abstract": "AIMS: Phytocannabinoids and terpenes from Cannabis sativa have demonstrated limited anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects in several inflammatory conditions. In the current study, we test the hypothesis that phytocannabinoids exert immunomodulatory effects in vitro by decreasing inflammatory cytokine expression and activation. KEY METHODS: CD3/CD28 and lipopolysaccharide activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors (n\u00a0=\u00a06) were treated with phytocannabinoid compounds and terpenes in vitro. Flow cytometry was used to determine regulatory T cell (Treg) and T helper 17 (Th17) cell responses to treatments. Cell pellets were harvested for qRT-PCR gene expression analysis of cytokines, cell activation markers, and inflammation-related receptors. Cell culture supernatants were analysed by ELISA to quantify IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-10 secretion. MAIN FINDINGS: In an initial screen of 20\u00a0\u03bcM cannabinoids and terpenes which were coded to blind investigators, cannabigerol (GL4a), caryophyllene oxide (GL5a) and gamma-terpinene (GL6a) significantly reduced cytotoxicity and gene expression levels of IL6, IL10, TNF, TRPV1, CNR1, HTR1A, FOXP3, RORC and NFK\u03921. Tetrahydrocannabinol (GL7a) suppression of T cell activation was associated with downregulation of RORC and NFK\u03921 gene expression and reduced IL-6 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) and IL10 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) secretion. Cannabidiol (GL1b) significantly suppressed activation of Tregs (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and Th17 cells (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in a follow-on in vitro dose-response study. IL-6 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and IL-10 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) secretion was significantly reduced with 50\u00a0\u03bcM cannabidiol. SIGNIFICANCE: The study provides the first evidence that cannabidiol and tetrahydrocannabinol suppress extracellular expression of both anti- and pro-inflammatory cytokines in an in vitro PBMC model of inflammation.",

    "title": "Comprehensive analysis of chemical and enantiomeric stability of terpenes in Cannabis sativa L. flowers.",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Cannabis sativa L. is renowned for its medicinal and recreational uses. With the increasing global legalization of C.\u00a0sativa L.-based products for medicinal purposes, there is a growing need for well-characterized products. While the stability of cannabinoids such as tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol is well understood, information on the chemical and enantiomeric stability of terpenes remains scarce. This is despite the fact that terpenes are also thought to have pharmacological activity and may contribute to the overall effect of C.\u00a0sativa L. METHODS: To address these challenges, four analytical methods based on chiral, polar, and apolar gas chromatographic separation combined with either MS or FID detection were developed and validated. These methods successfully separated and quantified a total of 29 terpenes, including 13 enantiomers and 5 diastereomers specific to C.\u00a0sativa L. Furthermore, terpenes and authentic C.\u00a0sativa L. flowers and extracts were subjected to UV and heat treatments to observe potential degradation reactions over time. RESULTS: Each terpene generates a unique pattern of degradation products resulting in a diverse array of oxidation and cyclization products. P-cymene was identified as a major product of terpene aging. Notably, no enantiomeric conversion was detected, suggesting that the formation of (-)-\u03b1-pinene in cannabis extracts, for example, originates from other terpenes. CONCLUSION: Terpenes have different degradation rates, even though they are structurally similar. In addition, cultivar- and growth-condition-specific enantiomeric ratios were observed in C.\u00a0sativa L., confirming that enantiomer production is species-specific and has to be considered for therapeutical applications.",
