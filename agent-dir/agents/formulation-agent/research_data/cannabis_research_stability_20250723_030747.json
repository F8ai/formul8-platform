    "title": "Harmonizing cannabis and environmental policy.",
    "abstract": "Policy fragmentation contributes to the myriad environmental impacts of the cannabis industry and impedes solutions. Examination of how this plays out in the context of the US provides real-world examples, further complicated by the lack of a robust overarching federal policy framework. A key determinant of environmental problems is whether cannabis cultivation is conducted indoors (greenhouses or windowless plant factories) or outdoors in open fields. For example, emissions of greenhouse gases are \u223c100-times greater for indoor cultivation, and water use is higher when accounting for water associated with power production. Other distinct spheres of impact involve land use, waste production, air pollution, ecosystem degradation, and adverse indoor environmental quality conditions faced by workers. Some consequences are differentially burdensome for marginalized populations, suggesting an overlay of environmental justice considerations. Relevant but uncoordinated regulatory entities include those focused formally on cannabis regulation, law enforcement, energy supply and demand, building codes, air quality, climate change, water supply and quality, waste management, fish and wildlife, occupational safety, public health, and urban planning. While criminalization has contributed to environmental concerns, both legal and illicit operations are problematic. Cannabis legalization enables improved policy coordination, but is not a panacea or intrinsic solution. The potential for policymaker collaboration and regulatory coordination includes removing barriers to improved practices and, in particular, providing incentives for lower-impact outdoor cultivation. However, politics often stands as an impediment to otherwise pragmatic policy solutions.",

    "title": "Effects of five cannabis oils with different CBD: THC ratios and terpenes on hypertension, dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis, oxidative stress, and CB1 receptor in an experimental model.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common liver disorder caused by oxidative stress and dysregulation of lipid metabolism. The endocannabinoid system (ECS), particularly the type 1 cannabinoid (CB1) receptor, plays a crucial role in NAFLD progression. Cannabinoids, such as cannabidiol (CBD) and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), along with terpenes, such as beta-myrcene and d-limonene, have shown potential therapeutic effects on liver health, particularly in reducing oxidative stress and modulating lipid metabolism. This study aimed to analyse the effects of five cannabis oils (COs), each with different CBD:THC ratios and terpenes content, on hypertension, dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis, oxidative stress, and CB1 receptor expression in an experimental model of NAFLD induced by a sucrose-rich diet (SRD) in Wistar rats for 3 weeks. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were fed either a: (1) reference diet (RD; standard commercial laboratory diet) or a: (2) sucrose-rich diet (SRD) for 3 weeks. 3 to 7 SRD\u2009+\u2009CO as following: (3) SRD\u2009+\u2009THC; (4) SRD\u2009+\u2009CBD; (5) SRD\u2009+\u2009CBD:THC 1:1; (6) SRD\u2009+\u2009CBD:THC 2:1; and (7) SRD\u2009+\u2009CBD:THC 3:1. The COs were administered orally at a dose of 1.5\u00a0mg total cannabinoids/kg body weight daily. The cannabinoid and terpenes content of all COs used in the study was determined. The terpenes found in COs were beta-myrcene, d-limonene, terpinolene, linalool, beta-caryophyllene, alpha-humulene, (-)-guaiol, (-)-alpha-bisabolol. During the experimental period, body weight, food intake and blood pressure were measured. Serum glucose, triglyceride, total cholesterol, uric acid, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (AP) levels were evaluated. Liver tissue histology, NAFLD activity score (NAS), triglyceride and cholesterol content, lipogenic enzyme activities, enzyme related to mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, reactive oxygen species (ROS), thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS), and antioxidant enzyme activities were also evaluated. The CB1 receptor expression was also determined. RESULTS: The results showed that SRD-fed rats developed hypertension, dyslipidemia, liver damage, hepatic steatosis, lipid peroxidation, and oxidative stress. This was accompanied by upregulation of liver CB1 receptor expression. CBD-rich CO, CBD:THC 1:1 ratio CO; CBD:THC 2:1 ratio CO and CBD:THC 3:1 ratio CO showed antihypertensive properties. THC-rich CO, CBD:THC 1:1 ratio CO; CBD:THC 2:1 ratio CO showed the greatest beneficial effects against hepatic steatosis and liver damage. All COs exhibited antioxidant effects in liver tissue. This was associated with normal liver CB1 receptor expression. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that COs, particularly THC-rich CO, CBD:THC ratio 1:1 CO, CBD:THC ratio 2:1 CO and terpenes, can effectively reduce dyslipidemia, liver damage and hepatic steatosis in SRD-induced NAFLD. COs with a higher proportion of CBD in their composition showed antihypertensive properties. All the COs exhibited antioxidant properties. These findings suggest that COs, especially those with CBD:THC ratios of 1:1 and 2:1 and terpenes, may represent a promising therapeutic approach for managing NAFLD and preventing its progression to more severe liver disease.",

    "title": "Characteristics and Trends in Child Cannabis Exposures During Legalization in California.",
    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: In 2016, California legalized cannabis for adult recreational use; after recreational sales began in 2018, it became the largest retail market worldwide. This study profiled specific risks and prevention opportunities across age groups and examined changes in medically significant child cannabis exposures before and after legalization. METHODS: Researchers conducted analyses, including interrupted time-series, to examine 1695 California Poison Control System (CPCS) reports of cannabis exposure in children 0-17 years of age, from 2010-2020. Analyses were confined to moderate and severe exposures, identified by CPCS toxicologists as requiring medical attention. RESULTS: Monthly rates of moderate/severe cannabis exposure per million children increased following legalization (\u03b2=0.06, CI [0.05, 0.08]), especially in children under 5. Fourteen percent required critical care admission. Exposures were primarily unintentional in younger children (87.7-99.2%) and intentional in adolescents (85.5%). Across all ages, most exposures occurred in the home (94.0%) and involved edible products (83.5%). An analysis of packaging on edible brands frequently cited in health records found that most could be easily mistaken for popular candies and snack foods. CONCLUSIONS: Following cannabis legalization in California, reports of child cannabis exposures requiring medical attention increased significantly. Most reported cannabis exposures occurred in the home through the ingestion of edible products, often packaged to look like popular candy and snack food brands. To prevent these harms, cannabis legalization should be accompanied by robust marketing and packaging regulations (e.g., plain labels, larger warning labels). Secondary prevention should focus on educating parents and caregivers on safe cannabis storage in the home.",

    "title": "Cannabis concentrate vaping chemistry.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This review article addresses the vaping chemistry of manufactured cannabis concentrates-a topic that remains under-researched despite the widespread availability and growing popularity of these products. Given their current prevalence and the fact that many of the findings discussed herein are from early-stage investigations, further research is essential to fully assess the public health risks associated with concentrate use. The purpose of this article is to help begin to bridge this knowledge gap by outlining the technical challenges of studying cannabis concentrates and to present evidence-based data concerning toxicant exposures as a foundation for future investigations. METHODS: A search of cannabis concentrate vaping within the date range of 2019-2025 on Google Scholar returned approximately 2,700 hits. A cannabis concentrate was defined as a sample containing at least 50% (w/w) cannabinoids. In addition to our group's articles, the search results contained six manuscripts that described at least a partial focus on molecular emissions specifically derived from vaping or dabbing samples that included cannabis concentrates. FINDINGS: Studying cannabis concentrate vaping poses distinct technical challenges that differ from those associated with electronic nicotine delivery systems. Emissions from vaping concentrates contain a substantial proportion of harmful aerosol toxicants, including isoprene, 3-methylcrotonaldehyde, 3-methyl-1-butene, and 2-methyl-2-butene. Moreover, some concentrate formulations have contained hazardous additives such as pine rosin and ketene precursors such as cannabinoid acetates. As with nicotine vaping, the presence of oxygen plays a critical role in driving the formation of many toxic chemical degradation products during vaping. CONCLUSION: Since the legalization of recreational cannabis, concentrates have become one of the most rapidly expanding segments of the U.S. cannabis market. However, research into the specific health risks of vaping these products has significantly lagged their widespread use. The studies presented in this review article highlight the potential for exposure to known toxicants during the vaping of cannabis concentrates.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Screw press extraction is widely used due to its simplicity and efficiency, but the impact of extraction temperature on oil characteristics requires further study. Existing studies highlight that high temperatures can improve yield but compromise oil quality. This study aims to assess the effects of different screw press extraction temperatures on hemp oil yield, composition and quality. METHODS: The study was conducted to examine the influence of screw press extraction temperatures (30, 60, 80, 100, 120 and 140\u00a0\u00b0C) on hemp oil yield and quality. Extracted oils were analyzed according to key parameters, including oil yield, total phenolic content, tocopherols, oxidation stability index (OSI), pigments, quality indices (free fatty acids (FFA), peroxide value (PV), conjugated diene (K232) and conjugated triene (K270)), fatty acid profiles and color parameters (L*, a*, b*, C* RESULTS: The temperature played a key role in yield, reaching a maximum of 21.82%, representing an oil recovery of 66.68% at 100\u00a0\u00b0C, an improvement of approximately 4% over cold pressing (30\u00a0\u00b0C). Increasing the extraction temperature from 30\u00a0\u00b0C to 140\u00a0\u00b0C resulted in an increase in tocopherol content from 410.84\u00a0mg/kg to 512.98\u00a0mg/kg. On the other hand, temperature had no significant effect on the TPC, which varied from 31.76\u00a0mg GAE/kg to 41.89\u00a0mg GAE/kg as confirmed by HPLC-DAD/ESI-MS\u00b2 analysis. On the other hand, oils extracted at higher temperatures were lower in quality, with higher PV, ranging from 6.36 meq O CONCLUSION: Extraction temperature has a significant influence on the yield and quality of hemp oil. Underline the importance of selecting the optimum extraction temperature to balance yield and quality.",

    "abstract": "Iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) have emerged as the most widely synthesized metal nanoparticles in sustainable chemistry due to their unique magnetic properties, excellent biocompatibility, biodegradability, and non-toxicity. In this study, IONPs are successfully synthesized via a rapid, sustainable, and environmentally friendly green synthesis approach using Cannabis sativa L. leaf extract. X-ray diffraction analysis determined that the synthesized NPs had an average particle size of 18.8\u2009nm, while transmission electron microscopy images reveal a spherical morphology with sizes ranging from 12 to 21\u2009nm. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy analysis confirmed the presence of cannabinoids, terpenoids, and flavonoids, which are believed to play a crucial role in the formation and stabilization of IONPs. Its photocatalytic potential is demonstrated through the degradation of bromophenol blue dye. Additionally, the NPs exhibited significant antibacterial and antifungal activity against various microbial species, along with promising anticancer effects on cancer cell lines. In conclusion, this study provides a promising foundation for advancing the large-scale, commercial production of IONPs through green synthesis methods. By offering an eco-friendly and efficient alternative to conventional nanoparticle synthesis, the findings contribute significantly to the growing body of research in sustainable nanotechnology.",

The fungal endophytes Metarhizium robertsii and Pochonia chlamydosporia were previously shown to improve hemp growth. Here, the impact of three fungal endophytes, M. robertsii, P. chlamydosporia as well as Trichoderma harzianum on hemp was investigated under treatment with 300\u2009mM NaCl as a salinity stress and reduced watering volume as a drought stress. Plant growth parameters, a lipid oxidation indicator, leaf porphyrins together with the abiotic stress responses genes were assessed in hemp with or without fungal colonization under normal and stressed conditions. Under salinity stress, the growth of hemp was ameliorated by the application of Metarhizium, Pochonia, or Trichoderma in the soil. The increased production of malondialdehyde (MDA) and the reduction in porphyrins in hemp under salinity stress were restored in the presence of fungal endophytes. Under drought stress, the aboveground growth of hemp was recovered by the application of Metarhizium together with the reduced production of porphyrins. The stress related gene CsNAC3 showed decreased expression during fungal application compared with uninoculated hemp under salinity or drought treatment. Colonization of Metarhizium, Pochonia or Trichoderma improved salt stress tolerance in hemp and this was accompanied by a reduction in oxidative stress.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Triterpenoid compounds such as betulinic acid (BA) and oleanolic acid (OA) exhibit considerable pharmacological activities. However, their current production primarily relies on plant extraction and chemical synthesis, methods that are often plagued by low efficiency, complex extraction processes, and environmental concerns. Microbial-based synthesis has emerged as one of the most effective approaches for producing BA and OA. RESULTS: This study presented the first identification of filamentous fungal strains efficiently synthesizing both BA and OA. The strain ZBS49 is a newly identified species of Clonostachys isolated from Gleditsia japonica Miq. (showing 99.82% sequence identity), produced 47.7\u00a0mg/L of BA. The strain XJ1-1, characterized as Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and isolated from Cannabis sativa L., yielded 65.76\u00a0mg/L of OA. After optimizing the culture medium and cultivation conditions, the yields of ZBS49 and XJ1-1 increased to 288.97 and 86.14\u00a0mg/L, representing improvements of 506% and 31%, respectively. Furthermore, we discovered that the BA extract of the ZBS49 strain significantly inhibited hepatocellular cancer cells (SMMC-7721 and HepG2) in a dose-dependent manner, with a minimum inhibitory concentration of 70 \u00b5M. Genomic analysis of Clonostachys sp. ZBS49 elucidated that the presence of 16 putative genes was related to triterpenoid biosynthesis and 6 distinct terpene biosynthetic gene clusters. Among the 145 CYP450, 5 genes involved in C-28 oxidation were predicted. CONCLUSIONS: This research underscores the effectiveness of filamentous fungi as a biotechnological platform for the efficient production of BA and its derivatives, highlighting their potential applications in cancer therapy. Furthermore, these findings provide valuable genetic resources and establish a robust technical and theoretical framework for utilizing ZBS49 as a microbial platform for the biosynthesis of triterpenoids.",

The gel was prepared in three variations with different hemp seed concentrations. We then analyzed the gel for pH and macronutrient composition. The sensory characteristics were analyzed for seven parameters, including appearance, taste, color, texture, aroma, consistency, and acceptability, using a hedonic scale on 25 panelists. A sensory analysis showed that sample A received an overall acceptability score of 7.16 \u00b1 0.99 from the sensory panel. The shelf life was observed at the recommended temperature of 4 degrees Celsius, which was 12 days. The best formulation was sample B with 38 g of hemp seeds, which showed better taste, color, aroma, and acceptability and a lower average pH value (6.68 \u00b1 1.44, 6.56 \u00b1 1.29, 7.6 \u00b1 1.16, 7 \u00b1 1.26, and 5.822 \u00b1 0.0183, respectively). Sample B contained 30.8 g of protein, 16.09 g of carbohydrates, 8.4 g of fat, and 263.16 kcal of energy per 100 g.

    "abstract": "On-site drug screening of oral fluid samples has gained attention because of its convenience and rapid results. The aim of this investigation was to compare the results of preliminary screening for drugs in oral fluid samples collected from suspected drug-impaired drivers using DrugWipe 6S and WipeAlyser reader with the results obtained from blood samples. Additionally, we compared the DrugWipe test results with findings of drug traces detected within the used DrugWipe devices. Police officers selected a sample of 355 suspected drug-impaired drivers in 2023. They used DrugWipe 6S for preliminary drug screening of drivers. After the field drug testing of oral fluid, the apprehended drivers were brought to a physician for the collection of blood samples. The collected samples (DrugWipe devices and blood samples) were submitted to the Norwegian National Forensic Toxicology Laboratory for analysis. The proportion of positive DrugWipe results that were unconfirmed when analysing blood samples was 82% for opiates, 75% for cocaine, and \u223c19%-20% for amphetamines, cannabis, and benzodiazepines. The proportion of negative DrugWipe results that were found positive in blood samples was for cannabis and benzodiazepines \u223c13%-14%, and for other drugs <3%. Detected drug traces in the used DrugWipe devices corresponded well with DrugWipe readouts for cannabis, amphetamines, and cocaine. The lack of correspondence between DrugWipe test results for cocaine and findings in blood may be due to the fact that the concentration of cocaine in saliva is often much higher than in blood, and the DrugWipe test is very sensitive. In addition, degradation and elimination of cocaine before the blood sample is taken may contribute to cocaine concentrations below the cut-off concentration in blood. For opiates and benzodiazepines, traces of drugs were found in relatively few DrugWipe devices. Many unconfirmed positives for opiates were most likely due to cross-reaction with substances in 'snus' (snuff tobacco).",

The caregiver reported cannabis products in the home in the form of gummies the caregiver takes for sleep and anxiety. What symptoms should prompt consideration of marijuana ingestion and how should accidental ingestion be managed? ANSWER: Cannabis is one of the most widely used drugs in the world. Many countries are decriminalizing and legalizing marijuana, but its negative impact on pediatric health is growing. Current evidence shows unintentional marijuana ingestion and severe toxicity are steadily increasing. Common symptoms of marijuana ingestion in young children are drowsiness, somnolence, nausea, and vomiting, with children being at high risk for severe symptoms of respiratory depression and seizures. Primary care providers should talk to families about issues surrounding marijuana in the home, including safe storage of products containing cannabis and when to suspect an accidental ingestion. Public health should focus on the packaging and distribution of edibles to prevent easy access and accidental ingestion by young children.",

    "abstract": "The quantification of harmful elements in cannabis is a relevant analytical task that requires metrological tools to ensure the reliability of the measurement results. This work reports the preparation and characterization of a certified reference material (CRM) for toxic elements-arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), and lead (Pb)-in pulverized, lyophilized cannabis leaf tissue. To prepare the CRM INM-040-1, a portion of dried ground cannabis vegetal material was spiked with the elements at mass fraction values close to the levels of interest in relevant regulations for this kind of matrix: 0.34 mg/kg for arsenic, 0.34 mg/kg for cadmium, and 0.66 mg/kg for lead. The elements were quantified by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) in combination with graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy (GF-AAS, for cadmium and lead) or hydride generation atomic absorption spectroscopy (HG-AAS, for arsenic). The analytical calibration was done by gravimetric standard addition for ICP-MS and GF-AAS, while bracketing calibration was used for HG-AAS. Furthermore, internal standard correction was used during ICP-MS measurements. The analytical methods were validated to demonstrate their fitness for purpose. The preparation variables of the CRM (particle size, drying treatment, and spiking conditions) were studied to improve the homogeneity of the CRM. The mass fraction of the toxic elements was certified with relative standard uncertainties ranging from 4.2 to 6.9%. The uncertainty contributions considered were the elements' mass fraction measurements, the between-methods bias, the (in)homogeneity of the production batch, and the (in)stability under transport and storage conditions. This new CRM constitutes a useful tool for the laboratories assessing the harmlessness of cannabis materials, promoting humans' safety and regulatory compliance within the medicinal cannabis industry.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic cannabinoids (SCs) are novel psychoactive substances (NPS) that are highly potent and associated with a range of severe toxicities. SC use, which is common in UK prisons and homeless communities, typically involves combustion of SC-soaked herb or paper material. Recently, e-cigarettes (or vapes) have emerged as popular delivery vehicles for SCs, and consumption among the general population has risen significantly. SC-containing e-cigarettes (or e-liquids) are typically sold as imitation cannabis-containing products and carry increased risk of adverse outcomes including psychosis, seizure, and cardiac arrest. Numerous incidences of overdose have been reported in UK schools. SCs cannot be identified in complex e-liquid matrices using current field-portable detection technologies, preventing the rapid screening of suspicious products. Herein, we report on the design and development of a device that can rapidly detect SCs and other relevant drugs in sealed e-cigarettes and e-liquids. We describe and implement a method to artificially actuate an e-cigarette, simultaneously depositing e-liquid vapor onto a physical matrix. We couple this extraction method with fluorescence-based detection to create a rapid and generic test for SC-containing e-cigarettes. In addition, we expand the potential of the detection modality by leveraging the photochemical degradation of THC and nitazenes on a solid matrix as a means for their detection from e-liquids and sealed e-cigarettes. We show that SCs, delta-9-THC and nitazenes can be detected in e-liquid from concentrations 0.2, 5, and 1.5 mg/mL, respectively.",

This study aimed to elucidate the role of the endogenous microbial community in the lignocellulosic degradation of hemp residues for biorefineries or other industrial processes, simultaneously characterizing the composition of three extracts recovered at different stages of maceration. The process was examined from different perspectives: plant tissue degradation and microbial dynamics were monitored using histological, cultural-dependent, and independent analysis. Extracts were characterized through FTIR, NMR, and SDS-PAGE analyses, also evaluating their potential as biostimulants for microbial growth. Results revealed that the composition of the endogenous prokaryotic community remained stable during the maceration period, while fluctuations in various fungal genera were observed. The taxonomical composition of hemp residues at different stages may account for the increased accumulation of amide-containing compounds, sugars, and other metabolites detected in long-term bioconversion. Finally, the extracts recovered from the microbial degradation of hemp residues were able to support the growth of the yeast ",

    "abstract": "CONTEXT: Evaluating medicinal cannabis in clinical trials is important for informing its efficacy and safety in clinical care. Alongside the inherent practical challenges of conducting clinical trials in people receiving palliative care, operationalizing clinical trials with a medicinal cannabis product requires additional consideration of legal, regulatory, ethical, feasibility, pharmacological and product requirements. OBJECTIVES: This manuscript aims to explore these considerations when operationalizing medicinal cannabis clinical trials in people receiving palliative care. METHODS: Our Phase I/IIb trial examined pharmacokinetic, toxicity and secondary (efficacy) outcomes of a vaporized medicinal cannabis product for anorexia in people with advanced cancer (ACTRN12616000516482). Using action research methodology, notes from trial investigator meetings served as an audit trail for the planning and execution of the trial. These data were integrated and synthesized to reveal key design considerations for operationalizing medicinal cannabis trials evaluating symptom control in people receiving palliative care. RESULTS: Six key considerations emerged including: 1) Operating within medicinal cannabis legislation; 2) Biological plausibility of cannabinoid type(s) and impact on target symptoms; 3) Standardising cannabinoid content, mode of administration, dosage and packaging; 4) Ethical and safety considerations; 5) Optimizing trial site operationalization; and 6) Pharmacy dispensing, storage and security of product. Learnings and recommendations for future trials are also discussed. CONCLUSION: This study explores the learnings and challenges involved in designing and conducting medicinal cannabis trials for symptom management in people receiving palliative care. These insights gained from our experience can inform the optimal design and operationalization of future medicinal cannabis trials in cancer and other chronic conditions.",

    "title": "Cannabidiol-A friend or a foe?",
    "abstract": "Cannabidiol (CBD), one of the main actives from Cannabis sativa has been perpetually explored lately for its therapeutic effects. Its main attributes, such as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, snowball into pain management, epilepsy and seizure alleviation, anxiety relief, as well as numerous other implications through the entire metabolism. However, conventional administration routes challenge its therapeutic potential, with reported poor water solubility, hepatic degradation, gastric instability and erratic bioavailability observed in oral administration. As a result, the transdermal delivery systems have emerged as a promising alternative to oral or inhaled routes, offering improved bioavailability and targeted effects. The medical use of CBD throughout Europe, UK, USA or Australia is extensive and usually represented by pharmaceutical preparations recommended after conventional treatment routs fail. The non-medical use is limited by each country's own legislation, a wider range of products being available, but the irregular regulatory landscape coupled with the growing market of cannabinoid-infused products, emphasizes the need for standardized formulations and further clinical research. The present work critically examines the transdermal administration of cannabidiol, explores the skin's potential as a route and the strategies involved in using it for systemic targeting. We highlighted key challenges and provided insights into CBD`s variable bioavailability based on different administration routes and methods, thus compiling a literature-based absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) study. We also explore the role of the endocannabinoid system, its function in various medical conditions, and the therapeutic effects associated with CBD, particularly in light of the varying legislation across countries. While the breadth of potential benefits is compelling, it is essential to emphasize the ongoing nature of CBD research as individual responses to it can vary significantly.",

    "abstract": "The decriminalization and legalization of cannabis have increased its consumption and the need for effective monitoring methods. Synthetic cannabinoids, while chemically distinct from natural cannabinoids like THC, can be more potent and cause severe adverse effects, often evading detection by traditional drug tests. Thus, there is a critical need for new biosensors that offer rapid, sensitive, and reliable detection of these compounds in biological samples. This study presents a novel electrochemical immunosensor based on aminated MXene integrated with poly(propylene carbonate) (PPC) nanofibers and monoclonal antibodies designed to enhance the detection of synthetic cannabinoids. The PPC/MXene-NH\u2082 nanofibers, electrospun onto screen-printed electrodes (SPEs), provide increased surface area and high sensitivity, stability, and selectivity. The biosensor achieved a wide detection range of 0.6-2000\u00a0ng/mL in saliva, a low limit of detection (LOD) of 0.66\u00a0ng/mL, and demonstrated excellent specificity. It showed high repeatability and reproducibility with minimal signal degradation, with vacuum-sealed storage proving to significantly extend sensor stability over time. These results highlight the potential of MXene-enhanced PPC nanofiber immunosensors as sensitive, selective, and portable tools for rapid detection of synthetic cannabinoids in clinical and forensic settings.",

    "abstract": "An impact of legalization and decriminalization of marijuana is the gradual increase in the use of cannabis for recreational purposes, which poses a potential threat to society and healthcare systems worldwide. However, the discovery of receptor subtypes, endogenous endocannabinoids, and enzymes involved in synthesis and degradation, as well as pharmacological characterization of receptors, has led to exploration of the use of cannabis in multiple peripheral and central pathological conditions. The role of cannabis in the modulation of crucial events involving perturbed physiological functions and disease progression, including apoptosis, inflammation, oxidative stress, perturbed mitochondrial function, and the impaired immune system, indicates medicinal values. These events are involved in most neurological diseases and prompt the gradual progression of the disease. At present, several synthetic agonists and antagonists, in addition to more than 70 phytocannabinoids, are available with distinct efficacy as a therapeutic alternative in different pathological conditions. The present review aims to describe the use of cannabis in neurological diseases and psychiatric disorders.",

    "abstract": "A six-year-old boy presented to the pediatric emergency department following an accidental ingestion of a synthetic cannabinoid. The child ingested an edible product containing tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and presented with lethargy, altered mental status, and increased muscle tone. The airway was protected, and the patient was breathing spontaneously. Initial assessment included a thorough history provided by the caregivers, which confirmed ingestion of cannabinoid gummies approximately two hours prior to presentation. An electrocardiogram demonstrated sinus tachycardia with a prolonged QTc. Toxicology screening was presumed positive for cannabinoids. Therapeutic management focused on supportive care. The patient was admitted to the hospital and discharged on hospital day two with no neurologic sequelae. The caregivers were provided with expectant management and counseled regarding safe storage and use of cannabis and cannabis-derived products. This case report discusses the growing incidence of cannabis exposure in the pediatric population while highlighting the biochemistry, clinical presentation, and therapeutic management of accidental ingestion of synthetic cannabinoids.",

Restoring autophagy has been proposed as a potential target for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. In our study, we used a neuroblastoma cell line that overexpresses wild-type \u03b1-synuclein to investigate the effects of cannabidiol on autophagy modulation and reduction in the level of cytosolic \u03b1-synuclein. Our results demonstrated that cannabidiol enhances the accumulation of LC3-II- and GFP-LC3-positive vesicles, which indicates an increase in autophagic flux. In addition, cannabidiol-treated cells showed a reduction in cytosolic \u03b1-synuclein levels. These effects were inhibited when the cells were treated with a CB",
