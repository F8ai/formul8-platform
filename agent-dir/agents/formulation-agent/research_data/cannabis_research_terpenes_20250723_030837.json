    "abstract": "Inhibition of melanogenesis is of major interest in the cosmetic industry. The mechanism underlying melanogenesis includes regulating tyrosinase by activating various signaling pathways, such as protein kinase A and C pathways. Natural material-based agents have recently gained attention as alternative medicines to suppress melanogenic pathways. Cannabis sativa contains many bioactive compounds that are widely used in traditional herbal medicines. The aim of this study was to identify and assess the anti-melanogenic effect of terpene extract from Cannabis sativa flower (TCF) to explore novel depigmenting agents. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed that TCF contains five monoterpenes, eleven sesquiterpenes, and a diterpene. MTT and melanin content assays demonstrated that TCF significantly decreased the melanin content per live cell in a dose-dependent manner. Tyrosinase inhibition assay showed that TCF exhibited little inhibitory effect on tyrosinase at an equal dose, which reduced the melanin content. However, western blot analysis revealed that TCF downregulated microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), and tyrosinase-related proteins TRP1, and TRP2 expression by suppressing PKC, p38, and ERK/STAT3, while upregulated Akt pathway in melan-a. These results highlight the potential application of TCF as a natural whitening agent in the cosmetics industry.",

    "title": "Effects of five cannabis oils with different CBD: THC ratios and terpenes on hypertension, dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis, oxidative stress, and CB1 receptor in an experimental model.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common liver disorder caused by oxidative stress and dysregulation of lipid metabolism. The endocannabinoid system (ECS), particularly the type 1 cannabinoid (CB1) receptor, plays a crucial role in NAFLD progression. Cannabinoids, such as cannabidiol (CBD) and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), along with terpenes, such as beta-myrcene and d-limonene, have shown potential therapeutic effects on liver health, particularly in reducing oxidative stress and modulating lipid metabolism. This study aimed to analyse the effects of five cannabis oils (COs), each with different CBD:THC ratios and terpenes content, on hypertension, dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis, oxidative stress, and CB1 receptor expression in an experimental model of NAFLD induced by a sucrose-rich diet (SRD) in Wistar rats for 3 weeks. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were fed either a: (1) reference diet (RD; standard commercial laboratory diet) or a: (2) sucrose-rich diet (SRD) for 3 weeks. 3 to 7 SRD\u2009+\u2009CO as following: (3) SRD\u2009+\u2009THC; (4) SRD\u2009+\u2009CBD; (5) SRD\u2009+\u2009CBD:THC 1:1; (6) SRD\u2009+\u2009CBD:THC 2:1; and (7) SRD\u2009+\u2009CBD:THC 3:1. The COs were administered orally at a dose of 1.5\u00a0mg total cannabinoids/kg body weight daily. The cannabinoid and terpenes content of all COs used in the study was determined. The terpenes found in COs were beta-myrcene, d-limonene, terpinolene, linalool, beta-caryophyllene, alpha-humulene, (-)-guaiol, (-)-alpha-bisabolol. During the experimental period, body weight, food intake and blood pressure were measured. Serum glucose, triglyceride, total cholesterol, uric acid, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (AP) levels were evaluated. Liver tissue histology, NAFLD activity score (NAS), triglyceride and cholesterol content, lipogenic enzyme activities, enzyme related to mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, reactive oxygen species (ROS), thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS), and antioxidant enzyme activities were also evaluated. The CB1 receptor expression was also determined. RESULTS: The results showed that SRD-fed rats developed hypertension, dyslipidemia, liver damage, hepatic steatosis, lipid peroxidation, and oxidative stress. This was accompanied by upregulation of liver CB1 receptor expression. CBD-rich CO, CBD:THC 1:1 ratio CO; CBD:THC 2:1 ratio CO and CBD:THC 3:1 ratio CO showed antihypertensive properties. THC-rich CO, CBD:THC 1:1 ratio CO; CBD:THC 2:1 ratio CO showed the greatest beneficial effects against hepatic steatosis and liver damage. All COs exhibited antioxidant effects in liver tissue. This was associated with normal liver CB1 receptor expression. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that COs, particularly THC-rich CO, CBD:THC ratio 1:1 CO, CBD:THC ratio 2:1 CO and terpenes, can effectively reduce dyslipidemia, liver damage and hepatic steatosis in SRD-induced NAFLD. COs with a higher proportion of CBD in their composition showed antihypertensive properties. All the COs exhibited antioxidant properties. These findings suggest that COs, especially those with CBD:THC ratios of 1:1 and 2:1 and terpenes, may represent a promising therapeutic approach for managing NAFLD and preventing its progression to more severe liver disease.",

    "abstract": "Terpenes are the largest and most diverse class of natural products, essential for plant defence, ecological interactions, and environmental adaptation. Cannabis sativa is noted for its rich terpene profile, influencing aroma, flavour, and pharmacological properties. Limonene, a significant monoterpene, is commercially important in the fragrance and flavouring industries, making it a target for metabolic engineering. Terpene biosynthesis involves terpene synthase enzymes that convert isoprenoid diphosphates into diverse terpene scaffolds. Despite advances in terpene biochemistry, C. sativa TPSs lack structural characterisation. This study presents the first crystal structure of (-)-limonene synthase from C. sativa, offering insights into monoterpene biosynthesis. Solved at 3.2\u00a0\u00c5 resolution, the structure shows an \"open\" conformation with a solvent-accessible active site and disordered loops near the catalytic pocket, indicating a pre-catalytic state that aids substrate access. Biochemical characterisation confirmed limonene synthase as a highly specific monoterpene synthase, predominantly producing (-)-limonene from geranyl diphosphate with minor amounts of eight other monoterpenes.

    "title": "Toward a Cannabis Terroir: Untargeted Metabolomic Profiling of Authentic Samples Using Gas Chromatography-High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry (GC-HRMS) and Liquid Chromatography-High-Resolution Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-HRMS/MS).",
    "abstract": "Cannabis sativa L. constituents, such as cannabinoids, terpenes, flavonoids, and other secondary metabolites, determine the plant's (medicinal) effects and properties in a complex interplay, a phenomenon known as the entourage effect. However, environmental influences like cultivation method, soil, light, and climate might also influence the plant's chemical composition-and thus its therapeutic profile. Much like in viticulture, the concept of a \"cannabis terroir\" might play an important role in determining the plant's chemical phenotype. The aim of this study was therefore to make these complex properties analytically accessible and develop a comprehensive metabolomics workflow using gas chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (GC-HRMS) and liquid chromatography-high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS/MS) in positive and negative ionization mode, applying HILIC and reversed phase chromatography to assess multiple chemical classes. Data processing and statistical analysis were done in MS-DIAL and MetaboAnalyst, respectively. The method was applied to 35 CBD-type cannabis flowers grown under different environmental conditions, and compounds belonging to various chemical classes were successfully detected. Principal component analysis revealed distinct clustering of the samples, and key discriminative features were identified, including cannabinoids, terpenes such as \u03b2-caryophyllene and \u03b1-humulene, cuticular alkanes (e.g., pentacosane and nonacosane), and polar compounds such as choline and trigonelline. The markers enabled a discrimination of samples not only by chemical phenotype but also by cultivation environment, supporting the emerging concept of a cannabis terroir. In conclusion, this study introduces an analytical framework for the comprehensive chemical profiling of cannabis employing GC-HRMS and LC-HRMS analysis and advanced statistical techniques.",

METHODS: Eleven female participants (5-16\u2009years) with a pathogenic variant in the MECP2 gene were recruited to this study, receiving NTI164 twice daily for 12\u2009weeks. The primary outcome measure was the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) Scale, with secondary outcomes measured using the CGI-Severity (CGI-S), RTT Behaviour Questionnaire (RSBQ), RTT-Symptom Index Score (RTT-SIS), RTT-Domain-Specific Concerns-Visual-Analog Scale (RTT-DSC-VAS), Impact of Childhood Neurological Disability/Quality of Life (ICND+QoL), and RTT-Caregiver Burden Inventory (RTT-CBI). Paired-samples t-test was used to assess significance between baseline and Week 12. RESULTS: Improvements were seen in the total CGI-I score (p\u2009=\u20090.028), with improvements in communication skills (p\u2009=\u20090.003), mental alertness (p\u2009=\u20090.033), socialisation/eye contact (p\u2009=\u20090.0004), attentiveness (p\u2009=\u20090.001), and anxiety (p\u2009=\u20090.004). CGI-S also demonstrated better outcomes after NTI164 administration (p\u2009=\u20090.008). RSBQ showed improvements in total score (p\u2009=\u20090.0005), general mood (p\u2009=\u20090.0003), breathing problems (p\u2009=\u20090.041), repetitive face movements (p\u2009=\u20090.004), and fear/anxiety (p\u2009=\u20090.006). RTT-DSC-VAS showed positive developments in abilities to communicate choices (p\u2009=\u20090.041). ICND total score was improved (p\u2009=\u20090.003), as well as cognition (p\u2009=\u20090.027) and Quality of Life (p\u2009=\u20090.0002). Total score on the RTT-CBI was improved (p\u2009=\u20090.006). CONCLUSION: NTI164 demonstrated safety and improved some clinical and functional outcomes in RTT. These improvements justify ongoing research into NTI164, which may be a potential adjunct therapy in RTT.",

    "abstract": "Cannabis sativa is a high-value plant renowned for its diverse chemical composition and abundant terpene content, contributing to its unique aroma, flavour, and therapeutic effects. Terpenes significantly influence consumer preference for C. sativa products, driving scientific interest in optimising terpene expression profiles and shaping the selective breeding of terpene profiles in C. sativa cultivars. In particular, the monoterpene, terpinolene, is influential in defining the sensory and therapeutic qualities of many C. sativa strains due to its woody, citrus-like aroma. Here we report the 2.5 \u00c5 resolution crystal structure of terpinolene synthase (CsTOS) from C. sativa in its apo form. The structure exhibits the class I monoterpene synthase fold with an open active site conformation. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we identified H618 as a key residues in determining product specificity. Substituting H618 with charged residues resulted in the preferential formation of limonene over terpinolene, highlighting its critical role in stabilising the substrate intermediate. Additionally, novel mutations uncovered an extended epistatic network of residues within 5 \u00c5 of the active site, spanning the \u03b1-helical bundle of the terpene synthase fold. These interactions contribute to monoterpene formation by modulating substrate positioning and catalytic activity. These insights advance our understanding of monoterpene biosynthesis and enable the targeted engineering of terpene synthases for customised terpene production, offering significant potential for the C. sativa industry.",

    "title": "Cannabis concentrate vaping chemistry.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This review article addresses the vaping chemistry of manufactured cannabis concentrates-a topic that remains under-researched despite the widespread availability and growing popularity of these products. Given their current prevalence and the fact that many of the findings discussed herein are from early-stage investigations, further research is essential to fully assess the public health risks associated with concentrate use. The purpose of this article is to help begin to bridge this knowledge gap by outlining the technical challenges of studying cannabis concentrates and to present evidence-based data concerning toxicant exposures as a foundation for future investigations. METHODS: A search of cannabis concentrate vaping within the date range of 2019-2025 on Google Scholar returned approximately 2,700 hits. A cannabis concentrate was defined as a sample containing at least 50% (w/w) cannabinoids. In addition to our group's articles, the search results contained six manuscripts that described at least a partial focus on molecular emissions specifically derived from vaping or dabbing samples that included cannabis concentrates. FINDINGS: Studying cannabis concentrate vaping poses distinct technical challenges that differ from those associated with electronic nicotine delivery systems. Emissions from vaping concentrates contain a substantial proportion of harmful aerosol toxicants, including isoprene, 3-methylcrotonaldehyde, 3-methyl-1-butene, and 2-methyl-2-butene. Moreover, some concentrate formulations have contained hazardous additives such as pine rosin and ketene precursors such as cannabinoid acetates. As with nicotine vaping, the presence of oxygen plays a critical role in driving the formation of many toxic chemical degradation products during vaping. CONCLUSION: Since the legalization of recreational cannabis, concentrates have become one of the most rapidly expanding segments of the U.S. cannabis market. However, research into the specific health risks of vaping these products has significantly lagged their widespread use. The studies presented in this review article highlight the potential for exposure to known toxicants during the vaping of cannabis concentrates.",
