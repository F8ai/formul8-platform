    "title": "Cannabis concentrate vaping chemistry.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This review article addresses the vaping chemistry of manufactured cannabis concentrates-a topic that remains under-researched despite the widespread availability and growing popularity of these products. Given their current prevalence and the fact that many of the findings discussed herein are from early-stage investigations, further research is essential to fully assess the public health risks associated with concentrate use. The purpose of this article is to help begin to bridge this knowledge gap by outlining the technical challenges of studying cannabis concentrates and to present evidence-based data concerning toxicant exposures as a foundation for future investigations. METHODS: A search of cannabis concentrate vaping within the date range of 2019-2025 on Google Scholar returned approximately 2,700 hits. A cannabis concentrate was defined as a sample containing at least 50% (w/w) cannabinoids. In addition to our group's articles, the search results contained six manuscripts that described at least a partial focus on molecular emissions specifically derived from vaping or dabbing samples that included cannabis concentrates. FINDINGS: Studying cannabis concentrate vaping poses distinct technical challenges that differ from those associated with electronic nicotine delivery systems. Emissions from vaping concentrates contain a substantial proportion of harmful aerosol toxicants, including isoprene, 3-methylcrotonaldehyde, 3-methyl-1-butene, and 2-methyl-2-butene. Moreover, some concentrate formulations have contained hazardous additives such as pine rosin and ketene precursors such as cannabinoid acetates. As with nicotine vaping, the presence of oxygen plays a critical role in driving the formation of many toxic chemical degradation products during vaping. CONCLUSION: Since the legalization of recreational cannabis, concentrates have become one of the most rapidly expanding segments of the U.S. cannabis market. However, research into the specific health risks of vaping these products has significantly lagged their widespread use. The studies presented in this review article highlight the potential for exposure to known toxicants during the vaping of cannabis concentrates.",

    "title": "A Validated GC-MS Method for Major Terpenes Quantification in Hydrodistilled Cannabis sativa Essential oil.",
    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Terpenes, which are found in high concentrations in the essential oil fraction of the Cannabis sativa flower, have demonstrated potential in many therapeutic and industrial applications. OBJECTIVES: This work reports on a method developed for quantifying 18 terpenes in C. sativa essential oil obtained through hydrodistillation. The following method has been evaluated for specificity, selectivity, accuracy, linearity, precision, stability, limit of detection, and limit of quantification. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Samples were prepared by separating the essential oil fraction through hydrodistillation and then diluting with ethyl acetate containing a 100\u2009\u03bcg/mL solution of n-tridecane and octadecane as internal standards. Analysis was performed on a gas chromatograph mass spectrometer (GCMS) using selected ion monitoring (SIM). RESULTS: The developed method enabled quantification of isomers of nerolidol and ocimene and several coeluting compounds, with recoveries of 87.35%-116.61%. Two cultivars of C. sativa flower were evaluated, and the dominant terpene compounds in both cultivars were \u03b2-myrcene (5.85-8.62\u2009mg/g dried plant) and \u03b2-caryophyllene (3.89-4.69\u2009mg/g), followed by \u03b1-humulene (1.35-1.99\u2009mg/g), limonene (0.91-1.33\u2009mg/g), and \u03b1-bisabolol (0.66-0.68\u2009mg/g). CONCLUSION: This method provides an accurate and reliable procedure for separating and quantifying the major terpene compounds in C. sativa flower using hydrodistillation and GCMS with SIM. The simplicity and solvent-free nature of the hydrodistillation extraction, combined with the specificity and accuracy of using SIM and external standards, enables the determination of total and individual terpenes concentrations within plant material and supports numerous industrial and therapeutic applications.",

    "abstract": "&lt;b&gt;Background and Objective:&lt;/b&gt; Amid the escalating challenge of antibiotic resistance, the exploration of new sources has become essential, with plants serving as a promising reservoir of bioactive compounds. &lt;i&gt;Cannabis sativa&lt;/i&gt; has attracted significant research interest for its antimicrobial properties and broad applications in medicine, industry and nutrition. This study aimed to investigate the antibacterial activity of ethanolic extracts from the stems and leaves of the Hang Kra Rog Phu Phan ST1 strain against twelve human pathogenic bacteria. &lt;b&gt;Materials and Methods:&lt;/b&gt; Stems and leaves from the Hang Kra Rog Phu Phan ST1 strain were subjected to ethanol extraction. The primary antibacterial activity of ethanolic extracts from Tanao Si Kan Dang RD1 was assessed using the disc diffusion method, while the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were determined via the broth microdilution method. The inhibition zone diameter (mm) was analyzed using Duncan's Multiple Range Test (DMRT) with the SAS software. &lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; The findings revealed that the ethanolic extract from the leaves of Hang Kra Rog Phu Phan ST1 produced the largest inhibition zone diameter of 10.00 mm against &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt; TISTR 008. The MIC and MBC of the leaf extract showed the lowest values of 0.09 and 0.19 mg/mL, respectively, recorded against &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; TISTR 1466. &lt;b&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/b&gt; This is the first report on the antibacterial activity of the ethanolic extracts from the leaves and stems of Hang Kra Rog Phu Phan ST1, which offers potential benefits for developing natural antibiotic drugs to combat infections caused by the tested pathogenic bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Increased acceptance of cannabis containing the psychoactive component, \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), raises concerns about the potential for impaired drivers and increased highway accidents. In contrast to the \"breathalyzer\" test, which is generally accepted for determining the alcohol level in a driver, there is no currently accepted roadside test for THC in a motorist. There is a need for an easily collectible biological sample from a potentially impaired driver coupled with an accurate on-site test to measure the presence and quantity of THC in a driver. A novel breath collection device is described, which includes three separate sample collectors for collecting identical A, B, and C breath samples from a subject. A simple one-step ethanol extraction of the \"A\" breath collector sample can be analyzed by UHPLC/selected ion monitoring (SIM) liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) to provide qualitative and quantitative determination of THC in breath sample in less than 4\u2009min for samples collected up to 6\u2009h after smoking a cannabis cigarette. SIM LC/MS bioanalyses employed d3-THC as the stable isotope internal standard fortified in negative control breath samples for quantitation including replicates of six calibrator standards and three quality control (QC) samples. Subsequent confirmation of the same breath sample in the B collectors was then confirmed by a reference lab by LC/MS/MS analysis. Fit-for-purpose bioanalytical validation consistent with pharmaceutical regulated bioanalyses produced pharmacokinetic (PK) curves for the two volunteer cannabis smokers. These results produced PK curves, which showed a rapid increase of THC in the breath of the subjects in the first hour followed by reduced THC levels in the later time points. A simpler single-point calibration curve procedure with calibrators and QC prepared in ethanol provided similar results. Limitations to this approach include the higher cost and operator skill sets for the instrumentation employed and the inability to actually determine driver impairment.",
