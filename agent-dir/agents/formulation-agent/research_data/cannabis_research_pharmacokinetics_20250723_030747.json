    "title": "Cannabis Use and Its Association with Complications and Outcomes in Burn Patients: Insights from the National Trauma Data Bank.",
    "abstract": "Cannabis use has increased with expanding legalization and societal acceptance, raising questions about its impact on burn care. Given its known effects on pain perception, metabolism, and immune modulation, cannabis may influence various aspects of burn treatment, including pain management, wound healing, and rates of infection. This study explores trends in cannabis use among burn patients and evaluates its association with clinical outcomes using the National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB). The NTDB was used to identify burn patients from 2017 to 2021, isolating burn injuries through e-code variables. Cannabis use was documented at admission, and patients without screening data were excluded. The primary exposure variable was cannabis use, with outcomes including mortality, stroke, myocardial infarction, organ failure, timing of surgery, and post-surgical complications. Secondary outcomes included ED vital signs, length of stay, and intensive care needs. Multivariable regression models were applied to analyze the association between cannabis use and outcomes. Of 319\u2009941 burn patients, 52\u2009803 (16.5%) tested positive for cannabis. Cannabis-positive patients were more likely to be male (18% vs. 11%, p<.001) and younger (28.9 vs. 32.6\u00a0years, p<.001). They had higher rates of venothromboembolic events, required longer ICU stays, and were more likely to develop ventilator-associated pneumonia. Additionally, cannabis-positive patients had a higher incidence of organ failure (2.1% vs. 1.3%, p=.012) and reoperations (5.2% vs. 4.1%, p=.019). Cannabis use in burn patients is associated with more complex recoveries, including higher risks of complications. Integrating cannabis screening into burn care protocols and further research is essential to optimize treatment strategies.",

    "title": "Effects of five cannabis oils with different CBD: THC ratios and terpenes on hypertension, dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis, oxidative stress, and CB1 receptor in an experimental model.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common liver disorder caused by oxidative stress and dysregulation of lipid metabolism. The endocannabinoid system (ECS), particularly the type 1 cannabinoid (CB1) receptor, plays a crucial role in NAFLD progression. Cannabinoids, such as cannabidiol (CBD) and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), along with terpenes, such as beta-myrcene and d-limonene, have shown potential therapeutic effects on liver health, particularly in reducing oxidative stress and modulating lipid metabolism. This study aimed to analyse the effects of five cannabis oils (COs), each with different CBD:THC ratios and terpenes content, on hypertension, dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis, oxidative stress, and CB1 receptor expression in an experimental model of NAFLD induced by a sucrose-rich diet (SRD) in Wistar rats for 3 weeks. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were fed either a: (1) reference diet (RD; standard commercial laboratory diet) or a: (2) sucrose-rich diet (SRD) for 3 weeks. 3 to 7 SRD\u2009+\u2009CO as following: (3) SRD\u2009+\u2009THC; (4) SRD\u2009+\u2009CBD; (5) SRD\u2009+\u2009CBD:THC 1:1; (6) SRD\u2009+\u2009CBD:THC 2:1; and (7) SRD\u2009+\u2009CBD:THC 3:1. The COs were administered orally at a dose of 1.5\u00a0mg total cannabinoids/kg body weight daily. The cannabinoid and terpenes content of all COs used in the study was determined. The terpenes found in COs were beta-myrcene, d-limonene, terpinolene, linalool, beta-caryophyllene, alpha-humulene, (-)-guaiol, (-)-alpha-bisabolol. During the experimental period, body weight, food intake and blood pressure were measured. Serum glucose, triglyceride, total cholesterol, uric acid, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (AP) levels were evaluated. Liver tissue histology, NAFLD activity score (NAS), triglyceride and cholesterol content, lipogenic enzyme activities, enzyme related to mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, reactive oxygen species (ROS), thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS), and antioxidant enzyme activities were also evaluated. The CB1 receptor expression was also determined. RESULTS: The results showed that SRD-fed rats developed hypertension, dyslipidemia, liver damage, hepatic steatosis, lipid peroxidation, and oxidative stress. This was accompanied by upregulation of liver CB1 receptor expression. CBD-rich CO, CBD:THC 1:1 ratio CO; CBD:THC 2:1 ratio CO and CBD:THC 3:1 ratio CO showed antihypertensive properties. THC-rich CO, CBD:THC 1:1 ratio CO; CBD:THC 2:1 ratio CO showed the greatest beneficial effects against hepatic steatosis and liver damage. All COs exhibited antioxidant effects in liver tissue. This was associated with normal liver CB1 receptor expression. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that COs, particularly THC-rich CO, CBD:THC ratio 1:1 CO, CBD:THC ratio 2:1 CO and terpenes, can effectively reduce dyslipidemia, liver damage and hepatic steatosis in SRD-induced NAFLD. COs with a higher proportion of CBD in their composition showed antihypertensive properties. All the COs exhibited antioxidant properties. These findings suggest that COs, especially those with CBD:THC ratios of 1:1 and 2:1 and terpenes, may represent a promising therapeutic approach for managing NAFLD and preventing its progression to more severe liver disease.",

    "title": "In Silico Assessment of Cannabidiol From Cannabis sativa as an Antiviral Agent Against Key Shrimp Pathogens in Aquaculture.",
    "abstract": "Shrimp aquaculture plays a crucial role in global food production but is increasingly threatened by viral and microsporidian pathogens such as White Spot Syndrome Virus (WSSV), Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei (EHP) and Infectious Hypodermal and Haematopoietic Necrosis Virus (IHHNV). Conventional reliance on antibiotics to combat these infections has raised serious concerns regarding antimicrobial resistance, environmental contamination and food safety. Additionally, environmental stressors such as salinity shifts and poor water quality exacerbate disease outbreaks, leading to severe production losses across Asia and Latin America. To explore eco-friendly therapeutic alternatives, this study assessed the antiviral potential of cannabidiol (CBD), a bioactive compound extracted from Cannabis sativa seed oil, identified through GC-MS analysis. Using molecular docking techniques, we evaluated CBD's interactions with key viral proteins: VP28 of WSSV, the tubulin \u03b2-chain of EHP and the capsid protein of IHHNV. The docking results revealed strong binding affinities of -6.61\u2009kcal/mol (EHP), -6.72\u2009kcal/mol (IHHNV) and -5.38\u2009kcal/mol (WSSV), indicating stable and potentially inhibitory interactions. Structural models were retrieved from RCSB PDB and SwissModel, while ligand preparation and docking were performed using AutoDock 4.2. CBD also demonstrated favourable pharmacokinetic and safety profiles, with predictions indicating no mutagenicity, hepatotoxicity or cardiotoxicity, and acceptable drug-likeness characteristics. Compared to other plant-derived compounds previously tested in shrimp disease models, CBD exhibited superior binding stability, more interaction residues and better bioavailability scores. These findings highlight CBD as a promising dual-function agent, capable of both modulating shrimp immunity and directly inhibiting key viral pathogens. These findings highlight cannabidiol (CBD) as a promising dual-action compound, with the potential to both enhance shrimp immune responses and exert direct antiviral effects against key pathogens. This study lays a robust groundwork for future in\u00a0vivo validations, formulation strategies and regulatory frameworks, ultimately supporting the development of sustainable, precision-based aquaculture health management.",

    "abstract": "Alcohol use disorder (AUD) remains a pervasive public health issue with limited effective treatments. Cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychotropic constituent of cannabis, shows promise in modulating addictive behaviors. This study investigated the effects of chronic CBD administration on alcohol dependence, withdrawal symptoms, and neurodegeneration using two complementary rodent models: chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) exposure, which models established alcohol dependence, and ethanol vapor self-administration (EVSA), which captures the volitional aspects of alcohol intake. In the CIE model, CBD reduced alcohol self-administration during acute withdrawal without affecting alcohol metabolism or locomotor activity. CBD decreased motivation for alcohol, somatic withdrawal signs, withdrawal-induced anxiety-like behaviors, and mechanical sensitivity. During extinction, CBD attenuated alcohol-seeking behavior and stress-induced reinstatement. Electrophysiological recordings revealed that CBD reversed alcohol-induced decreases in neuronal excitability in the basolateral amygdala, suggesting a mechanism involving normalization of neural function. In the EVSA model, CBD reduced voluntary alcohol intake during the escalation phase, impacting voluntary alcohol intake. This effect was specific to alcohol-related behaviors, as it did not affect saccharin self-administration. Immunohistochemical analyses showed that CBD prevented alcohol-induced neurodegeneration in the nucleus accumbens shell and dorsomedial striatum, regions implicated in the volitional control of alcohol consumption. These findings indicate that chronic CBD administration attenuates both behavioral and neurobiological facets of alcohol dependence by modulating neuronal excitability and preventing neurodegeneration, supporting its therapeutic potential for AUD and providing mechanistic insights for future research.",

Cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive compound from Cannabis sativa, has shown anticancer properties. This review analyzes CBD's therapeutic potential in HCC, focusing on mechanisms, preclinical/clinical findings, and integration into treatment strategies. A systematic search (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar) up to March 2025 identified 16 relevant studies (in vitro, in vivo, clinical). CBD exerts antitumor effects via multiple pathways, including apoptosis, autophagy regulation, metastasis suppression, and tumor microenvironment modulation. CBD interacts with the endocannabinoid system (ECS), inhibits oncogenic signaling (PI3K/AKT/mTOR), and enhances chemotherapeutic efficacy (sorafenib, cabozantinib). Studies show CBD induces pyroptosis via caspase-3/GSDME, and modulates autophagy by inhibiting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. It also sensitizes HCC cells to sorafenib and cabozantinib. Preclinical results are promising, but clinical studies are limited. Challenges like bioavailability and potential hepatotoxicity require investigation. Future research should optimize formulations, determine dosing, and conduct clinical trials to validate CBD's efficacy/safety in HCC patients. Validated CBD could offer an innovative HCC management option.",

According to this analysis of 16 papers and 18 patents (2019-2024), CBD that has been nanoformulated offers improved tolerability, sustained release, and skin delivery. According to GRADE review, impacts on dermal absorption, inflammation, and wound healing demonstrated intermediate certainty, but outcomes such as skin penetration, controlled release, and safety showed high certainty. Applications for acne, psoriasis, and eczema show enhanced patient compliance and efficacy. Despite clinical and regulatory obstacles, nano-CBD platforms provide a safe, focused, and efficient approach to improving dermatological care.",

    "abstract": "Cannabis and cannabinoid mixtures have been linked to a variety of health benefits including pain mitigation, suppression of nausea produced by chemotherapeutic agents, anti-inflammatory effects, and effects on energy homeostasis, glucose, and lipid metabolism. The latter properties have led to the suggestion that these products could have therapeutic effects on the development of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) - a severe type of liver pathology in obese and diabetic patients. However, varying agonist and antagonistic properties of different cannabinoids on the endogenous cannabinoid system make prediction regarding hepatic effects and diet interactions difficult. The current study was designed to examine hepatic pathology following chronic administration of a cannabinoid mixture (NEPE14) at a dose equivalent to one previously demonstrating antihyperalgesic effects in rats. The effects of NEPE14 were investigated in a mouse model of MASH produced by feeding a Western diet rich in fat and simple sugars. After 24 weeks of NEPE14 administration, there was no hepatotoxicity in mice receiving the control diet and no significant exacerbation of MASH in mice receiving the Western diet. In conclusion, no chronic liver toxicity was observed, but there was also no evidence for protection against MASH by this product.",

    "title": "Innovations in Cannabis Delivery Systems: A Patent Review (2012-2024).",
    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Cannabis sativa has been cultivated for over 11,700 years, originating in Central and Southeast Asia, and has been used for medical, recreational, and religious purposes. Among its therapeutic potentials, it is notable for its capacity to alleviate pain, nausea, anxiety, and more. The plant's primary secondary metabolites are cannabinoids, which interact with the endocannabinoid system to produce these effects. However, due to the dosage variability and the secondary effects associated with a lack of targeted action, their medical use is limited, creating the need for effective delivery systems. METHODOLOGY: This systematic patent review on cannabis drug delivery systems was conducted using patents retrieved from the Espacenet database. The search employed the keywords \"Cannabis\" and \"Delivery,\" along with the IPC classification code A61, to filter patents filed between 2012 and 2024. This initial search yielded 99 patents, which were further screened to identify 15 patents that met the inclusion criteria. RESULTS: Of the selected patents, most originated from the United States, followed by Canada, international patents (WIPO), and China. A notable increase in patent filings occurred in 2022, coinciding with the peak in scientific publications on the topic. This trend indicates a growing interest in the design of cannabis delivery systems. DISCUSSION: The historical importance and therapeutic potential of Cannabis sativa are welldocumented, yet modern medical use remains restricted due to pharmacokinetic limitations. Delivery systems such as extracellular vesicles, microneedles, and emulsions have been developed to improve the bioavailability and stability of cannabinoids. Extracellular vesicles facilitate targeted, noninvasive delivery of cannabinoids to the central nervous system. Microneedles offer a painless method for transdermal administration, overcoming skin barrier limitations. Emulsions improve the solubility and bioavailability of lipophilic cannabinoids, making them suitable for various administration routes. CONCLUSION: Since 2012, there has been considerable growth in patents and publications related to cannabis drug delivery systems, driven by the therapeutic potential of cannabinoids. Innovations in delivery systems like emulsions, microneedles, and extracellular vesicles aim to improve the pharmacokinetics and therapeutic efficacy of cannabis-derived compounds, representing a shift towards medical cannabis applications.",

    "abstract": "Cannabis sativa is a medicinally and economically significant plant known for its production of cannabinoids, terpenoids, and other secondary metabolites. This study presents a transcriptomic analysis to elucidate tissue-specific expression and regulatory mechanisms across leaves, stems, and roots. A total of 2,530 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, with key genes such as terpene synthase (TPS) and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) exhibiting elevated expression in leaf tissues, emphasizing their roles in terpenoid and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. Alternative splicing (AS) analysis revealed 8,729 distinct events, dominated by exon skipping, contributing to transcriptomic diversity. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) prediction identified 3,245 candidates, many of which displayed tissue-specific expression patterns and co-expression with metabolic genes, suggesting regulatory roles in secondary metabolism. Additionally, 12,314 SNPs and 2,786 INDELs were detected, with notable enrichment in genes associated with secondary metabolite biosynthesis, particularly in leaf tissues. These findings advance the understanding of molecular mechanisms governing secondary metabolism and genetic diversity in C. sativa, providing valuable insights for future metabolic engineering and breeding strategies to enhance cannabinoid production.",

    "title": "Cannabidiol as an immune modulator: A comprehensive review.",
    "abstract": "Cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive phytocannabinoid derived from Cannabis sativa, has emerged as a promising therapeutic agent due to its diverse pharmacological properties, including potent anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, and immunomodulatory effects. CBD modulates immune responses, including the regulation of T cell activity, induction of macrophage apoptosis, suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and modulation of signaling pathways involved in inflammation and immune homeostasis. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases to identify relevant preclinical and clinical studies on CBD's immunomodulatory effects. Preclinical and clinical studies demonstrate its efficacy in treating autoimmune diseases such as Type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease, along with its potential in neuropathic pain and cancer therapy. Recent advancements in nanotechnology-based delivery systems have further enhanced CBD's therapeutic potential by improving its solubility, bioavailability, and targeted delivery, enabling innovative approaches for wound healing, inflammation management, and cancer treatment. However, challenges such as variability in immune responses, limited long-term safety data, and potential drug-drug interactions persist. This review comprehensively examines CBD's pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and immunomodulatory mechanisms, highlighting its clinical potential, existing limitations, and future directions in advancing its integration into precision medicine and immune regulation.",

    "abstract": "Phytocannabinoids are natural products with highly promising pharmaceutical potential, mainly known from the plant Cannabis\u00a0sativa. However, their bioavailability is limited due to their high lipophilicity. Modification through glycosylation is known to improve the water solubility and stability of molecules. Enzymatic glycosylation requires specific enzymes with high catalytic activity in combination with efficient production systems. To date, only a few glycosyltransferases with activity toward cannabinoids have been described. In this study, we explore the substrate spectrum of the promiscuous UDP-glycosyltransferase CrUGT74AN3 from Catharanthus\u00a0roseus and demonstrate activity towards a broad range of cannabinoids and their biosynthetic intermediates. The highest activity was observed using cannabidiol (CBD) as an acceptor molecule. In addition, we show efficient biotransformation of CBD in an engineered Saccharomyces\u00a0cerevisiae strain. We investigate the influence of the hydrolytic activity of endogenous glucosidases and identify the UDP-glucose supply as a limiting factor in the yeast system. The co-expression of CrUGT74AN3 and a cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase from Bacillus\u00a0licheniformis in the engineered yeast strain led to the production of CBD-glycosides with up to six glucose moieties from CBD and cyclodextrin in\u00a0vivo. Finally, we confirm the applicability of the engineered yeast systems to other cannabinoids using cannabigerol and cannabinol.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cannabidiol (CBD) is the primary non-psychoactive component of cannabis. Consumption of CBD is increasing rapidly as it is federally legal and widely available in the United States, Europe, Mexico, Canada, and Asia. CBD is gaining traction in medical and biochemical research, though a comprehensive classification of CBD receptor interactions is yet to be elucidated. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search across PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar identified studies reporting cannabidiol (CBD) interactions with receptors, enzymes, and biological processes. Eligible articles included cell culture, animal model, biochemical, and clinical studies. Findings were thematically synthesized by body system, emphasizing mechanisms and implications for health and disease. RESULTS: Herein, I compile the literature to date of known interactions between CBD and various receptors, enzymes, and processes. I discuss the impact of CBD exposure on multiple processes, including endocannabinoid receptors, ion channels, cytochrome 450 enzymes, inflammatory pathways, and sex hormone regulation. I explain the potential effects of CBD on psychiatric disorders, seizure activity, nausea and vomiting, pain sensation, thermal regulation, neuronal signaling, neurodegenerative diseases, reproductive aging, drug metabolism, inflammation, sex hormone regulation, and energy homeostasis. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding how CBD functions and how it can interact with other recreational or pharmaceutical medications is necessary for proper clinical management of patients who consume CBD.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The prevalence and accessibility of \u03948-tetrahydrocannabinol (\u03948-THC), a chemical isomer of \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol (\u03949-THC), has increased drastically, yet no controlled studies have directly compared the effects of vaporized \u03948-THC and \u03949-THC . METHODS: Twenty healthy adults with no past-month cannabis exposure completed five randomized outpatient sessions in a within-subjects, double-blind, crossover design. Participants inhaled \u03948-THC (10, 20, 40mg), \u03949-THC (20mg), or placebo (distilled water) using the Mighty Medic vaporizer. Measures included subjective drug effects, cognitive/psychomotor performance, puff topography, vital signs, and whole blood concentrations of \u03948-THC, \u03949-THC, and their metabolites. RESULTS: All \u03948-THC doses and \u03949-THC produced subjective drug effects that differed from placebo. 20mg \u03949-THC elicited stronger ratings of \"drug effect\" and \"unpleasant\" than 10mg \u03948-THC; no other subjective effects differed between \u03948-THC and \u03949-THC. 20mg \u03949-THC impaired DRUID performance compared with placebo; no other significant differences were observed between conditions on cognitive/psychomotor measures. Few pharmacodynamic differences were observed between \u03948-THC doses. Evidence of compensatory puffing emerged, with longer/larger puffs at lower \u03948-THC doses and placebo. Blood cannabinoid concentrations revealed that \u03948-THC metabolism differed from \u03949-THC, with less psychoactive 11-OH metabolite formed after \u03948-THC exposure. CONCLUSION: Various doses of vaporized \u03948-THC elicited comparable psychoactive effects as vaporized \u03949-THC, which is noteworthy considering \u03948-THC is less potent and generally perceived as less harmful/intoxicating than \u03949-THC. The magnitude of effects from cannabinoids is dictated by several factors including dose, route of administration, and, for inhaled methods, puffing behaviors. These data should be considered in future drug policy and public education initiatives.",

    "abstract": "This narrative review synthesizes the toxicological, clinical and medico-legal aspects of paediatric cannabis intoxication. By providing a comprehensive overview, it aims to inform future research, guide policymaking, and enhance clinical and toxicological practice in addressing this growing public health concern. The pharmacokinetics of cannabinoid ingestion in children are significantly influenced by the immaturity of their gastrointestinal tract and metabolic enzyme systems, resulting in altered oral bioavailability. Clinical data indicate that \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-related effects in paediatricpaediatric patients typically emerge within 2\u00a0hours of ingestion, with more severe symptoms developing within 4\u00a0hours. The endocannabinoid system (ECS) undergoes significant developmental changes, with marked differences in cannabinoid receptor expression and distribution across fetal, neonatal, and adult brains. During neurodevelopment, CB1 receptors exhibit unique expression patterns, including transient localization in brainstem regions critical for neurovegetative functions. These developmental dynamics likely explain children's heightened sensitivity to THC's neurological and neurovegetative effects, often resulting in more severe outcomes compared to adults. The reliable detection of cannabinoids involves integrating screening methods with confirmatory analytical techniques. Urine immunoassay testing is widely considered an helpful toolto assess a previous exposure, becoming positive within 3-4\u00a0h of ingestion. However, this method is prone to false positives. Plasma THC concentration, when measured close to the event, offers valuable insights into the quantity ingested and the correlation between exposure and clinical outcomes in the impairment window. Hair analysis, while useful for distinguishing between acute and chronic use, is susceptible to various biases. The rising incidence of acute cannabis intoxication in children underscores the urgent need for targeted public health interventions and stricter regulatory frameworks. Preventive measures such as child-resistant packaging, public education campaigns, and cannabis use screening during pregnancy are essential to mitigate risks. Clinicians should consider THC exposure in the differential diagnosis of children presenting with unexplained neurological, immune, or metabolic symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Substance use disorders (SUDs) are widely prevalent in many countries, with the highest rates observed in nicotine and alcohol use, followed by opioid and cannabis use disorders. Within the field of SUDs, nutrition has become an increasingly important area of focus in both epidemiology and public health, as malnutrition is frequently observed among individuals affected by these disorders. Research indicates that people with SUDs are more likely to experience malnutrition than the general population; however, this issue remains an often-overlooked consequence that can impact disease progression and recovery outcomes. SUDs disrupt brain metabolism, leading to changes in brain function and disturbances in glucose, protein, and lipid metabolism. Evidence shows that individuals with certain SUDs often suffer from poor nutritional status, marked by high sugar consumption and insufficient intake of key micronutrients like iron, as well as vitamins D, C, A, and B-likely due to prioritizing drug use over adequate food intake. Importantly, diet can alter the metabolism and effects of drugs, potentially amplifying or diminishing their impact. While nutrition should play a central role in SUD treatment and rehabilitation, current research-both in animal models and human studies-on the role and benefits of specific nutrients in this context remains limited. This literature review aims to synthesize the available findings on the impact of malnutrition in human and murine models of SUDs, with the goal of identifying which nutrients may provide the most support for treatment and recovery.",

    "title": "Cannabinoids in neuropathic pain treatment: pharmacological insights and clinical outcomes from recent trials.",
    "abstract": "Neuropathic pain, a complex and often devastating condition, poses significant challenges for its effective management. Despite promising research on various cannabis formulations and delivery methods for neuropathic pain, significant gaps remain in our knowledge. While inhaled cannabis shows analgesic effects and alternative delivery methods may improve bioavailability, oral formulations have yielded mixed results, often limited by small sample sizes and placebo effects. Therefore, further research is essential to optimize cannabis formulations, identify responder profiles to tailor treatments effectively, and, most critically, confirm the long-term safety and efficacy of cannabis-based therapies in managing NP. This review article aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the therapeutic potential of cannabis-based medicines, with a particular focus on cannabinoids. This review, though not systematic, examines 11 clinical studies, specifically Randomised Clinical Trials) published from 2014 to 2024, highlighting the efficacy of numerous cannabis formulations, in alleviating neuropathic pain. Key findings show that cannabinoids can reduce pain perception, improve patient quality of life, and mitigate other symptoms associated with neuropathic pain. The synergistic effects of tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol are discussed, emphasizing their ability to enhance analgesic effects, while potentially reducing the psychoactive side effects of tetrahydrocannabinol. This review emphasizes the importance of the personalized approach to improve therapeutic outcomes. Limitations of the existing research focusing on cannabis for neuropathic pain are limited by heterogeneity, lack of standardization, small sample sizes, and reliance on subjective outcomes, impacting the reliability and generalizability of findings. However, this exhaustive review aims to inform clinicians and researchers about the evolving role of cannabis in contemporary pain management strategies, illustrating the diverse pharmacological profiles of cannabinoids and their potential as adjunct therapies for neuropathic pain management.",

    "abstract": "AIMS: The study aimed to explore the sustainable synthesis of metal nanoparticles using a green and eco-friendly resource. Specifically, it investigated the utilization of Cannabis sativa waste extract for the production of gold and silver nanoparticles, focusing on their antimicrobial activity against gram-negative bacteria, particularly Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, which are significant in nosocomial infections. METHODS: Cannabis sativa waste extract was employed to synthesize gold and silver nanoparticles through a green synthesis approach. The produced nanoparticles were characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The antimicrobial efficacy of the synthesized nanoparticles was assessed through their minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), and minimal biofilm inhibitory concentration (MBIC) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, utilizing a microcultivation device, solid medium cultivation, and a metabolic activity assay in a polystyrene microtiter plate, respectively. RESULTS: The TEM analysis revealed the size and morphology of the nanoparticles, while AAS confirmed their concentration. XRD provided insights into the crystalline structure, and FTIR analysis identified the molecular structure of the nanoparticle's stabilizing layer. The synthesized nanoparticles showed significant antimicrobial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with determined MIC, MBC, and MBIC values of produced silver nanoparticles, showcasing their potential as effective antimicrobial agents. CONCLUSIONS: This study successfully demonstrated the synthesis of silver and gold nanoparticles using Cannabis sativa waste extract and highlighted their potent antimicrobial properties. It underscores the potential of utilizing plant waste extracts in sustainable nanomaterial synthesis and contributes to the fields of green nanotechnology and waste valorization within the circular economy. The findings also offer valuable insights into developing natural waste source-based antimicrobial agents.",

    "abstract": "Neuroinflammation is a hallmark of various neurodegenerative disorders, yet effective treatments remain limited. This study investigates the neuroprotective potential of a cannabidiol (CBD)-Rich Cannabis sativa L. (CS) extract in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation mouse model. The effects on anxiety-like behavior, cognitive function, and locomotor activity were assessed using behavioral tests (open field, elevated plus maze, novel object recognition, and Morris water maze). Antioxidant activity was measured by assaying glutathione (GSH) levels and lipid peroxidation by-products (TBARs). Anti-inflammatory properties were evaluated using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (QRt-PCR) for proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) mRNAs in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Astrocytic bioenergetics were analyzed using extracellular flux assays. Additionally, computational inference with a deep learning approach was conducted to evaluate the synergistic interactions among CS phytocompounds on the CB1 receptors. Compared with synthetic CBD, the CS extract (20.0\u2009mg/kg) demonstrated superior efficacy in mitigating LPS-induced anxiety-like behavior, cognitive deficits, and locomotor impairments. It also significantly mitigated oxidative stress (increased GSH, reduced TBARs) and suppressed proinflammatory cytokines and GFAP mRNAs, indicating potent anti-inflammatory properties. The extract modulated CB1 receptor expression and preserved metabolic homeostasis in cortical astrocytes, preventing their shift from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation under neuroinflammatory conditions. Computational modeling highlighted conformational changes in CB1 receptor residues induced by Delta-9-THC that enhanced CBD binding. These findings underscore the potential of CS extract as a therapeutic candidate for managing neuroinflammation and its associated neurodegenerative consequences, warranting further clinical exploration.",

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Academy of Pediatrics discourage cannabis use during pregnancy and breastfeeding due to safety concerns for the fetus and infant. Despite these recommendations, nearly half of active cannabis users continue use in pregnancy. In this review, we summarize cannabis pharmacology and metabolism with a focus on delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, the psychoactive component of the cannabis plant, highlighting its significance in quantifying exposure and the impact on outcomes studies. We also provide a concise review of current evidence on the effects of perinatal cannabis use and pregnancy, infant, and childhood outcomes, acknowledging the limitations of this evidence. Additionally, we provide targeted counseling recommendations for harm reduction strategies and lactation considerations for birthing parents who use cannabis.",
