    "title": "Wisconsin Young Adults' Attitudes, Beliefs, Motivations, and Behaviors Surrounding E-Cigarette Use and Cessation.",
    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use is prevalent among young adults, yet cessation treatment options are limited and underutilized. METHODS: Wisconsin residents aged 18 to 24 who had vaped nicotine in the past month (N\u2009=\u2009480) completed an online survey assessing vaping initiation, past quit experiences, future quit intentions, and treatment knowledge and preferences. The survey also assessed perceived physical and mental health harms of vaping nicotine and other products (eg, cannabis, cannabidiol). RESULTS: Most young adults had made a prior e-cigarette quit attempt, commonly motivated by concerns about addiction, cost, and health problems. Though 80% want support to quit, preferred methods of support were highly variable. The same methods (eg, medication, friends/family, health care provider, therapist) that were most endorsed as the form of support young adults were most likely to use were also among the most endorsed forms of support that young adults would not want to use. Nearly 40% of participants reported vaping cannabis and perceived vaping cannabis as significantly less harmful than vaping nicotine or tobacco for physical and mental health. CONCLUSIONS: Vaping cessation resources that are responsive to young adults' needs and preferences are needed. The high variability in treatment preferences suggests that multiple strategies need to be offered; there is no one-size-fits-all approach. Cannabis vaping is prevalent, and an important area for future research is to examine the impact of cannabis vaping on nicotine vaping dependence, cessation, and treatment use. Strategies to reach, motivate, and engage young adults in e-cigarette cessation and cessation treatment should highlight their concerns about addiction, costs, health harms, and desired treatment options.",

    "title": "[The cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome-A narrative review].",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Until 25\u00a0years ago cyclic vomiting attacks under the chronic influence of cannabis were virtually unknown. Following the legalization of non-medical cannabis in North America and the associated increase in cannabis use, including high-potency strains, the number of patients there with cannabis-related cyclic vomiting is increasing. The ROME-IV criteria now define cannabis-induced cyclic vomiting as cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS). This review aims to provide information about CHS, as an increase in cases is also to be expected in Germany following legalization. METHOD: Selective review article. RESULTS: The CHS is most frequently registered in emergency departments. A\u00a0clear differentiation between CHS and cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS), in which one third of those affected also regularly use cannabis, is only possible by establishing full remission during a\u00a06-12\u00a0month cannabis abstinence. Therefore, mixed forms of CVS and CHS are initially seen in emergency departments (suspected CHS), also with hidden life-threatening abdominal comorbidities. Severe vomiting can also lead to serious complications. The commonly used antiemetics often do not help. Hot showers and baths as well as i.m. haloperidol (5\u202fmg) can provide acute relief from severe vomiting. Rubbing the abdomen with 0.075-0.1% capsaicin cream also has an antiemetic effect but less quickly. DISCUSSION: In ROME-IV the CHS is nosologically considered a\u00a0special variant of CVS. In particular, it is a\u00a0specific cannabis-related, often severe physical disorder. As healing can only be achieved through sustained cannabis abstinence, suspected CHS in emergency departments is an interdisciplinary challenge for gastroenterology, neuropsychiatry and the addiction support system.",

    "abstract": "Cannabis use is increasingly prevalent among individuals with epilepsy, yet its impact on seizure control remains poorly understood. While cannabidiol (CBD) has demonstrated antiseizure properties and gained FDA approval for specific epileptic syndromes, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive compound in cannabis, may alter neuronal excitability and potentially exacerbate seizure activity. We present two illustrative case reports of male patients with focal epilepsy and chronic cannabis use who underwent treatment with antiseizure medications and responsive neurostimulation (RNS). In both cases, cannabis use was temporally associated with breakthrough seizures and poor seizure control. These cases highlight the complex and multifactorial relationship between cannabis use and seizure outcomes, including potential pharmacokinetic interactions with antiseizure medications (ASM) and the possibility that cannabis may blunt the neuromodulation effects of RNS. Given the retrospective data and limited detail on cannabis use, these findings should be interpreted with caution. As cannabis use rises among individuals with epilepsy, further research is needed to clarify its potential effects on seizures and treatment response, including neuromodulation.",

    "title": "Evaluating Household Income and Tobacco Exposure as Moderators of the Association Between Prenatal Cannabis Exposure and Newborn Neurobehavior.",
    "abstract": "Prevalence rates for substance exposure during pregnancy are increasing, with cannabis emerging as one of the most common substances used. Infants with prenatal cannabis exposure face a greater risk of neurobehavioral vulnerabilities. The current study sought to examine the association between prenatal cannabis exposure and newborn neurobehavior, while also considering potential moderators (i.e., tobacco exposure and household income). The study included 115 pregnant individuals and their newborns enrolled in the Atlanta African American Maternal-Child cohort. Researchers quantitatively measured biomarkers of cannabis (COOH-THC) and tobacco smoke (COT) in urine samples collected at enrollment. Self-reported substance use was also collected during the first trimester of pregnancy. Newborn neurobehavior was assessed at 1\u00a0month of age (M\u00a0=\u00a025.3 days' old, SD\u00a0=\u00a014.41) using the NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scale. There were no significant main effects of self-reported prenatal cannabis use or prenatal COOH-THC concentrations on newborn neurobehavior. Additionally, tobacco exposure did not moderate these associations. Significant interactions were found between household income and prenatal COOH-THC levels in predicting newborn attention and arousal. Specifically, cannabis-exposed newborns exhibited attenuated attention and heightened arousal if they were from low-income households. Our findings highlight the potential role that socioeconomic factors may play in influencing behavior associated with prenatal exposures.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Whether cannabis is a risk factor for cardiovascular events is unknown. We examined the association between smoking cannabis and cardiovascular events in a cohort of older veterans (66 to 68 years of age) with coronary artery disease. METHODS: The THC Cohort (Heart and Cannabis) comprised 4285 veterans (mean [SD] age, 67.5 [1.01] years; 2% female) with coronary artery disease who were born in 1950 to 1952. Participants were recruited between April 5, 2018, and March 12, 2020, interviewed about health behaviors, and then classified according to their self-reported cannabis smoking status in the previous 30 days. In a separate analysis, we classified participants according to any form of cannabis use (smoking, vaping, or edible use) versus nonuse in the past 30 days. Data on demographic, behavioral, and clinical characteristics were collected by telephone interview and from national Department of Veterans Affairs and Medicare data sources. The primary outcome included a composite of fatal and nonfatal stroke, fatal and nonfatal acute myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular death. The follow-up period for each patient extended from the date of their initial interview until the end of study (June 14, 2022). All participants were followed until they experienced an outcome or until the end of the follow-up period. Survey nonresponse weights and propensity score-based weights were used to reduce bias and confounding. Hazard ratios were estimated using cause-specific hazard models. RESULTS: The cohort included 1015 veterans with coronary artery disease who reported smoking cannabis in the previous 30 days and 3122 veterans who did not smoke cannabis in the previous 30 days. Mean follow-up was 3.3 years, and 563 events occurred. Compared with veterans who did not smoke cannabis, smoking cannabis (past 30 days) was not associated with the composite outcome of acute myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.61-1.24]). Similarly, use of any form of cannabis (smoking, vaping, dabbing, edibles) in the past 30 days was not associated with the composite outcome. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of older veterans with coronary artery disease, self-reported cannabis use was not independently associated with increased cardiovascular events over a mean of 3.3 years of follow-up.",

    "abstract": "Despite the widespread use of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) as the gold standard for dopamine (DA) replacement in Parkinson's Disease (PD), its prolonged administration frequently leads to L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID), a significant therapeutic challenge. Modulating the endocannabinoid system has emerged as a promising approach for managing LID. This study explored whether cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive compound of Cannabis sativa, and PECS-101, a fluorinated derivative of CBD, could mitigate the onset and progression of LID. We used unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats, treated with L-DOPA (10\u202fmg\u202fkg\u202f-\u202f1) for three weeks to induce severe abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs). Treatments were administered during the final two weeks. CBD (30\u202fmg\u202fkg\u202f-\u202f1) and PECS-101 (3 and 30\u202fmg\u202fkg\u202f-\u202f1) significantly reduced AIMs without impairing the motor benefits of L-DOPA. The antidyskinetic effects of CBD were associated with decreased striatal Fos-B and phospho-ERK expression and were independent of lesion severity. CBD effects were prevented by antagonists of CB1 (1\u202fmg\u202fkg\u202f-\u202f1) and PPAR\u03b3 (4\u202fmg\u202fkg\u202f-\u202f1) receptors. Co-administration of TRPV-1 antagonist capsazepine (5\u202fmg\u202fkg\u202f-\u202f1) enhanced the antidyskinetic effects of CBD. Combining the capsazepine with the neuronal nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, 7-nitroimidazole (10\u202fmg\u202fkg\u202f-\u202f1) enhanced these effects. CBD did not alter striatal DA levels but significantly increased the concentrations of anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol in dyskinetic animals. The antidyskinetic effects of CBD were associated with a reduction of the enhanced striatal glia and peripheral inflammation markers. These findings suggest that CBD alleviates LID by interacting with the nitrergic neurotransmission and TRPV-1, CB1, and PPAR\u03b3 receptors.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Polysubstance use-use of more than one substance- is prevalent and an emergent public health issue. Yet not much is known about factors associated with same-day polysubstance use among adolescents. This study examined correlates of same-day tobacco and cannabis use/co-use among adolescents who use tobacco/cannabis. METHODS: Cross-sectional data were from 10th and 11th grade students (n=536) who reported tobacco/cannabis use. Regression models were used to examine intrapersonal, psychological (anxiety, depression), societal (societal concern, discrimination), and environmental (public and home secondhand smoke/vape exposure) correlates of past 30-day usage frequency (no, infrequent, and frequent use) of same-day: poly-product use (poly-tobacco/nicotine [use of different types of nicotine/tobacco]; poly-cannabis [use of different types of or marijuana/THC]); poly-drug use [tobacco/nicotine and marijuana/THC], and nicotine and THC vape mixing. RESULTS: Participants were predominantly Hispanic (66.23%) and male (62.50%). Among participants, 8.58%, reported frequent same-day poly-tobacco use, 13.81% frequent same-day poly-cannabis use, 13.25% frequent same-day poly-drug use, and 3.36% vape mixing. Past 30-day alcohol use was associated with higher odds (1.88-8.31, p<.05) of infrequent and frequent same day use of all study outcomes except vape mixing. Secondhand smoke/vapor exposure was consistently associated with higher odds (1.13-1.26, p<.05) of infrequent/frequent same day use. Discrimination increased the odds of some same-day polysubstance use while societal concerns had inconsistent effects across study outcomes. CONCLUSION: A significant proportion of adolescents who use tobacco/cannabis products might engage in high-risk use patterns. Alcohol use, societal, and environmental factors significantly increase the likelihood of same-day poly-use of tobacco and cannabis products.",

    "title": "Synaptic signatures of perinatal cannabinoids: A systematic review of rodent hippocampal synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory.",
    "abstract": "The expanding legalization of cannabis raises significant public health concerns about its use during pregnancy, particularly due to the limited understanding of its impact on neurodevelopment. Existing research suggests that perinatal cannabis or cannabinoid exposure may impair learning and memory; however, variations in study design hinder the ability to draw generalizable conclusions. Clinical studies are limited in their observational nature and the lack of insight into neural or cellular mechanisms underlying cognitive changes, underscoring the importance of preclinical studies to explore the effects of perinatal cannabinoids in greater detail. The objective of this systematic review is to consolidate findings from existing preclinical research that investigates the effects of perinatal cannabinoid exposure on learning and memory and the putative mechanism of learning and memory, hippocampal synaptic plasticity, in rodents. This review summarizes studies on hippocampal synaptic plasticity (n\u2009=\u20092), spatial/visual memory (n\u2009=\u200913), working memory (n\u2009=\u20096), recognition memory (n\u2009=\u200912), and associative memory (n\u2009=\u20097). Perinatal cannabinoid-induced impairments were reported in the two synaptic plasticity studies, and in 24 out of 30 studies that examined learning and memory, with spatial memory tasks showing the most consistent deficits. While the existing evidence converges on the notion that perinatal cannabinoid exposure negatively impacts hippocampal physiology and associated memory functions, further research is needed to disentangle the influence of various methodological factors, including offspring sex and age, cannabinoid type, time of gestational exposure, and method of administration.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Cannabis use among U.S. older adults has risen rapidly over the past two decades. This study examined the changes in and correlates of cannabis-involved substance use treatment admissions among this demographic. METHODS: Using the 2000-2021 concatenated Treatment Episode Data Set-Admissions (TEDS-A) age 50+ ( RESULTS: During the study period, the number of cannabis-involved admissions increased substantially, while their share of all admissions increased and then decreased as other drug-related admissions increased. The annual percentage changes (APC) show that the shares of cannabis-involved admissions of all admissions between 2000 and 2012 increased for the 50-64 age group and then decreased between 2012 and 2021. In the 65+ age group, the shares increased between 2000 and 2016 (APC=5.2) and then plateaued. Compared to no-cannabis admissions, the likelihood (relative risk ratio) of all cannabis-involved admissions was higher among males, black people, residents of states where medical or recreational cannabis use was legal, and referrals from healthcare providers and court/criminal legal systems. The likelihood (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]) of cannabis-primary admissions was higher among those age 65+ (aOR=1.04, 95%CI=1.00-1.08), black people (aOR=1.34, 95% CI=1.32-1.36), Hispanic people (aOR=1.26, 95% CI=1.23-1.29), residents of states with medical cannabis laws, and those who were referred by healthcare providers and legal systems. IMPLICATIONS: Cannabis-involved admissions are projected to continue to increase as cannabis use continues to increase. More effective regulations and enforcement of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol potency and research on cannabis harms and poly-substance use are needed to protect the health of older adults who turn to cannabis for its purported health benefits. Increased availability and accessibility of treatment infrastructure are also needed.",

    "title": "Machine-learning of medical cannabis chemical profiles reveals analgesia beyond placebo expectations.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The efficacy of medical cannabis in alleviating pain has been demonstrated in clinical trials, yet questions remain regarding the extent to which specific chemical compounds contribute to analgesia versus expectation-based (placebo) responses. Effective blinding is notoriously difficult in cannabis trials, complicating the identification of compound-specific effects. METHODS: In a prospective study of 329 chronic pain patients (40% females; aged 48.9\u2009\u00b1\u200915.5) prescribed medical cannabis, we examined whether the chemical composition of cannabis cultivars could predict treatment outcomes. We used a Random Forest classifier with nested cross-validation to assess the predictive value of demographics, clinical features, and approximately 200 chemical compounds. Model robustness was evaluated using six additional machine learning algorithms. RESULTS: Here we show that incorporating chemical composition markedly improves the prediction of pain relief (AUC\u2009=\u20090.63\u2009\u00b1\u20090.10) compared to models using only demographic and clinical features (AUC\u2009=\u20090.52\u2009\u00b1\u20090.09; p\u2009<\u20090.001). This result is consistent across all models tested. While well-known cannabinoids such as THC and CBD provide limited predictive value, specific terpenoids, particularly \u03b1-Bisabolol and eucalyptol, emerge as key predictors of treatment response. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that pain relief can be predicted from cannabis chemical profiles that are unknown to patients, providing evidence for compound-specific therapeutic effects. These results highlight the importance of considering the full range of cannabis compounds when developing more precise and effective cannabis-based therapies for pain management.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alcohol and delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) (main impairing ingredient of cannabis) are both crash contributors that interfere with motor vehicle operation. However, the relationship between drug concentration and crash injury severity is unclear for either drug. We aim to clarify the relationship between blood alcohol concentration (BAC) and crash injury severity, based on healthcare system utilisation, with and without THC. METHODS: The National Drug Driving Study is an ongoing prospective study involving 17 Canadian trauma centres. Eligible subjects included drivers aged 16+ who visited a participating trauma centre and had blood drawn as part of routine care within 6\u2009hours of a crash. Deidentified blood samples were tested for alcohol and THC using gas chromatography-flame ionisation detection and liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. Study outcomes included admission to hospital and admitted patients' length of hospital stay. RESULTS: 10\u2009322 injured drivers visited a participating trauma centre between 2018 and 2023. 1649 (16.0%), 1716 (16.6%) and 463 (4.5%) drivers had detectable levels of alcohol, THC or both, respectively. Compared with sober drivers (BAC=0), drivers with 0%<BAC<0.08% had increased odds of admission (aOR=1.69, 95%\u2009CI=1.31 to 2.19), as did drivers with BAC\u22650.08% (aOR=1.36, 95%\u2009CI=1.16 to 1.60). THC did not modify the relationship between alcohol and admission. Neither alcohol nor THC predicted were associated with length of stay following admission. INTERPRETATION: Alcohol increases hospital admissions after crashes but does not have a dose-response relationship with admission or length of stay. THC does not moderate this relationship.",

Today, a wide variety of cannabis products and alternatives are available in the legal and illicit markets. Harms associated with their use may vary depending on the amount and type of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) they contain. Few studies have examined the awareness of and use of these different cannabis products among adolescents. METHODS: Our study examined patterns of cannabis use in adolescent patients of an urban pediatric addiction clinic. RESULTS: Most adolescents seen at the clinic use multiple cannabis products, and many adolescents use cannabinoid derivatives such as delta-8 and delta-10 THC. DISCUSSION: These results highlight the need for providers to explore in depth the various cannabis products used by adolescents, educate adolescents on the products, especially due to unknown risks associated with cannabinoid derivatives, and advocate for further regulation of alternative cannabis products.",

    "abstract": "Cannabis use during pregnancy is increasing, often to alleviate stress and anxiety, yet the long-term effect of prenatal cannabis exposure alone or in combination with psychosocial stress on offspring neurodevelopment or maternal behaviors remains unclear. Here, we developed a translational rodent model combining prenatal \u0394\u2079-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) exposure with chronic psychosocial stress using the maternal witness defeat stress (MWDS) paradigm. Pregnant C57BL/6 mice were exposed to MWDS from gestational day (GD) 3-12 and received daily subcutaneous THC (2 mg/kg) or vehicle until birth. All exposure groups showed impaired maternal behavior, with negative postnatal outcomes and caregiving, with additive effects observed in the combined exposure group. In adolescence, male and female offspring exhibited exposure-specific behavioral alterations. Prenatal stress and combined exposures led to increased anxiety-like behavior and reduced motivated behavior in both sexes, while THC alone primarily impacted female self-care and social behavior. Transcriptomic profiling of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) of adolescent offspring revealed sex- and region-specific gene expression changes across all exposure groups. Prenatal THC-, stress-, and combined exposures each altered distinct molecular pathways related to mitochondrial function, synaptic organization, and glial signaling. Comparative analysis with a perinatal fentanyl model revealed shared transcriptional substrates involved in synaptic signaling and circadian regulation. These findings indicate that THC and stress independently and additively impair maternal behaviors with lasting neurodevelopment signatures in offspring.",

The objective of this study is to assess risk perceptions of cannabis and CBD use during pregnancy among pregnant and non-pregnant patients. METHODS: The study design is multi-method; a cross-sectional survey assessing use behaviors and risk perceptions is supplemented with qualitative focus group discussions (FGDs). Recruitment for surveys was from outpatient obstetrics clinics and recruitment for FGDs was from the same clinics and a substance-use treatment clinic, from October 2022 to February 2023. The survey instrument was developed via combining question items from validated instruments that assess cannabis and CBD use and risk perceptions. Comparisons of response frequency distributions for pregnant versus non-pregnant participants were calculated with chi-square analysis for individual risk perception question items. Data from the FGDs were coded and analyzed via a deductive content analysis approach. RESULTS: There were 261 survey respondents and 5 FGDs ( CONCLUSION: Findings indicate uncertainty of risk related to cannabis and CBD use during pregnancy regardless of current pregnancy or lactation status, despite prevalent ever use of cannabis and CBD in those who were pregnant. This suggests an urgent need for clearer risk communication about cannabis and CBD use in pregnancy.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Cannabis-based products for medicinal use, also referred to as cannabinoid-containing products, particularly those containing cannabidiol as the primary active constituent, have shown to be a possible alternative in treating various health conditions in companion animals. Thus, this systematic review aims to synthesise and analyse the available data on the efficacy/effectiveness and safety of cannabis-based products for medicinal use in dogs and cats to assist in clinical decision-making. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review was conducted across PubMed, LILACS, Scopus, and Google Scholar from February 2014 to February 2024. The search strategy included both MeSH terms and free-text keywords related to medical cannabis, including Medical Marijuana, Cannabis and Cannabaceae, combined with terms referring to domestic cats and dogs. Additionally, title/abstract keywords, including Cannab (as a truncated term), were used to retrieve literature on cannabinoids and their therapeutic applications. RESULTS: Twenty-two articles were identified examining cannabidiol-based formulations for osteoarthritis, epilepsy, atopic dermatitis, postsurgical pain, and behavioural issues. Cannabis-based products for medicinal use with cannabidiol as the primary active constituent demonstrated improvements in pain, behaviour, and seizures, with no serious adverse events. However, research on their use in cats is limited to two studies. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: While promising, the long-term efficacy/effectiveness, optimal dosages, and safety of cannabis-based products for medicinal use remain unclear. Further studies are needed to confirm their therapeutic potential and ensure safe veterinary use.",

    "title": "Effects of five cannabis oils with different CBD: THC ratios and terpenes on hypertension, dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis, oxidative stress, and CB1 receptor in an experimental model.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common liver disorder caused by oxidative stress and dysregulation of lipid metabolism. The endocannabinoid system (ECS), particularly the type 1 cannabinoid (CB1) receptor, plays a crucial role in NAFLD progression. Cannabinoids, such as cannabidiol (CBD) and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), along with terpenes, such as beta-myrcene and d-limonene, have shown potential therapeutic effects on liver health, particularly in reducing oxidative stress and modulating lipid metabolism. This study aimed to analyse the effects of five cannabis oils (COs), each with different CBD:THC ratios and terpenes content, on hypertension, dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis, oxidative stress, and CB1 receptor expression in an experimental model of NAFLD induced by a sucrose-rich diet (SRD) in Wistar rats for 3 weeks. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were fed either a: (1) reference diet (RD; standard commercial laboratory diet) or a: (2) sucrose-rich diet (SRD) for 3 weeks. 3 to 7 SRD\u2009+\u2009CO as following: (3) SRD\u2009+\u2009THC; (4) SRD\u2009+\u2009CBD; (5) SRD\u2009+\u2009CBD:THC 1:1; (6) SRD\u2009+\u2009CBD:THC 2:1; and (7) SRD\u2009+\u2009CBD:THC 3:1. The COs were administered orally at a dose of 1.5\u00a0mg total cannabinoids/kg body weight daily. The cannabinoid and terpenes content of all COs used in the study was determined. The terpenes found in COs were beta-myrcene, d-limonene, terpinolene, linalool, beta-caryophyllene, alpha-humulene, (-)-guaiol, (-)-alpha-bisabolol. During the experimental period, body weight, food intake and blood pressure were measured. Serum glucose, triglyceride, total cholesterol, uric acid, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (AP) levels were evaluated. Liver tissue histology, NAFLD activity score (NAS), triglyceride and cholesterol content, lipogenic enzyme activities, enzyme related to mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, reactive oxygen species (ROS), thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS), and antioxidant enzyme activities were also evaluated. The CB1 receptor expression was also determined. RESULTS: The results showed that SRD-fed rats developed hypertension, dyslipidemia, liver damage, hepatic steatosis, lipid peroxidation, and oxidative stress. This was accompanied by upregulation of liver CB1 receptor expression. CBD-rich CO, CBD:THC 1:1 ratio CO; CBD:THC 2:1 ratio CO and CBD:THC 3:1 ratio CO showed antihypertensive properties. THC-rich CO, CBD:THC 1:1 ratio CO; CBD:THC 2:1 ratio CO showed the greatest beneficial effects against hepatic steatosis and liver damage. All COs exhibited antioxidant effects in liver tissue. This was associated with normal liver CB1 receptor expression. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that COs, particularly THC-rich CO, CBD:THC ratio 1:1 CO, CBD:THC ratio 2:1 CO and terpenes, can effectively reduce dyslipidemia, liver damage and hepatic steatosis in SRD-induced NAFLD. COs with a higher proportion of CBD in their composition showed antihypertensive properties. All the COs exhibited antioxidant properties. These findings suggest that COs, especially those with CBD:THC ratios of 1:1 and 2:1 and terpenes, may represent a promising therapeutic approach for managing NAFLD and preventing its progression to more severe liver disease.",

METHODS: Protoscoleces and cysts were incubated in vitro with the C. sativa extract, achieving final CBD concentrations of 1, 5, 10, and 50\u00a0\u00b5g/ml. Viability was evaluated periodically. Structural and ultrastructural alterations were also recorded. For the clinical efficacy study, female CF-1 mice were infected. Six months later, mice were divided into groups (n\u2009=\u200910): (a) water control; (b) ABZ; (c) C. sativa extract, and (d) ABZ\u2009+\u2009C. sativa extract. Treatments were administered every 24\u00a0h for 30 days. The efficacy of the treatments was evaluated according to the weight of the cysts collected and the ultrastructural alterations observed. RESULTS: The C. sativa extract caused a significant decrease in the viability of protoscoleces and cysts in vitro. The greatest effect was observed with 50\u00a0\u00b5g/ml, which generated the reduction in protoscoleces viability to 0% between 6 and 24\u00a0h post-incubation (pi) and the collapse of 92\u2009\u00b1\u200913% of the cysts after 24\u00a0h pi. All the in vivo treatments reduced the weight of the cysts and caused ultrastructural alterations, especially the combination of ABZ\u2009+\u2009C. sativa extract. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of a full-spectrum extract of C. sativa inflorescences against E. granulosus s.s.",

    "title": "In Silico Assessment of Cannabidiol From Cannabis sativa as an Antiviral Agent Against Key Shrimp Pathogens in Aquaculture.",
    "abstract": "Shrimp aquaculture plays a crucial role in global food production but is increasingly threatened by viral and microsporidian pathogens such as White Spot Syndrome Virus (WSSV), Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei (EHP) and Infectious Hypodermal and Haematopoietic Necrosis Virus (IHHNV). Conventional reliance on antibiotics to combat these infections has raised serious concerns regarding antimicrobial resistance, environmental contamination and food safety. Additionally, environmental stressors such as salinity shifts and poor water quality exacerbate disease outbreaks, leading to severe production losses across Asia and Latin America. To explore eco-friendly therapeutic alternatives, this study assessed the antiviral potential of cannabidiol (CBD), a bioactive compound extracted from Cannabis sativa seed oil, identified through GC-MS analysis. Using molecular docking techniques, we evaluated CBD's interactions with key viral proteins: VP28 of WSSV, the tubulin \u03b2-chain of EHP and the capsid protein of IHHNV. The docking results revealed strong binding affinities of -6.61\u2009kcal/mol (EHP), -6.72\u2009kcal/mol (IHHNV) and -5.38\u2009kcal/mol (WSSV), indicating stable and potentially inhibitory interactions. Structural models were retrieved from RCSB PDB and SwissModel, while ligand preparation and docking were performed using AutoDock 4.2. CBD also demonstrated favourable pharmacokinetic and safety profiles, with predictions indicating no mutagenicity, hepatotoxicity or cardiotoxicity, and acceptable drug-likeness characteristics. Compared to other plant-derived compounds previously tested in shrimp disease models, CBD exhibited superior binding stability, more interaction residues and better bioavailability scores. These findings highlight CBD as a promising dual-function agent, capable of both modulating shrimp immunity and directly inhibiting key viral pathogens. These findings highlight cannabidiol (CBD) as a promising dual-action compound, with the potential to both enhance shrimp immune responses and exert direct antiviral effects against key pathogens. This study lays a robust groundwork for future in\u00a0vivo validations, formulation strategies and regulatory frameworks, ultimately supporting the development of sustainable, precision-based aquaculture health management.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Among diverse chemical profile of  METHODS: We explored 14 cannabinoids with an inverse molecular docking approach, docking each cannabinoid into  RESULTS: Our analysis of the inverse molecular docking results identified high scoring targets with potential as novel protein targets for minor cannabinoids, the majority associated with cancer, while others have connections with neurological disorders and inflammation. We highlighted GTPase KRas and hematopoietic cell kinase (HCK) as very promising potential targets due to favorable docking scores with almost all investigated cannabinoids. We also find multiple matrix metalloproteinases among the top targets, suggesting possible novel therapeutic opportunities in rheumatic diseases. An analysis of inverse molecular docking fingerprints shows similar binding patterns for cannabinoids with similar structures, minor structural differences still suffice to change the affinity to specific targets. Hierarchical clustering of inverse molecular docking fingerprints revealed two main clusters in protein binding pattern similarity, the first encompassing THC-class and similar cannabinoids, as well as CBL-class cannabinoids, while the second contained CBD, CBC, and CBG-class cannabinoids. Notably, CBL-class cannabinoids exhibited binding patterns more similar to THC-class cannabinoids than their CBC-class precursors, possibly offering potential therapeutic benefits akin to THC with fewer psychotropic effects. DISCUSSION: This study highlights the therapeutic potential of minor cannabinoids and identifies their potential novel protein targets. Moreover, we demonstrate the utility of inverse molecular docking fingerprinting with clustering to identify compounds with similar binding patterns as well as identify pharmacophore-related compounds in a structurally agnostic manner, paving the way for future drug discovery and development.",

However, CBD crosses the placenta and accumulates in the fetal brain, where it can activate or repress the function of several molecular targets that are important for brain development. While consumption of high doses of CBD during pregnancy have been shown to disrupt offspring neurodevelopment and postnatal behavior, lower, more clinically relevant doses have not been assessed. Here, we show that oral consumption of 10 mg/kg/day CBD during pregnancy increases thermal pain sensitivity in exposed male mouse offspring. Additionally, we find that the same dose impairs cognition and reduces excitability of the prefrontal cortex in exposed female mouse offspring. These data show that lower doses of CBD consumption during pregnancy can impair fetal brain development and postnatal behavior.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The use of medicinal cannabis is increasing worldwide and has applications in managing a wide range of conditions, including neurological, rheumatological, and gastrointestinal diseases. Despite its growing prevalence, there are limited data on patterns of cannabis prescription across varying disease groups and demographic subgroups. METHODS: This retrospective observational cohort study analysed cannabis usage patterns among 263 patients from the cannabis user clinic at Rabin Medical center (RMC), a tertiary hospital in Israel. To minimise the inclusion of recreational cannabis users, only patients aged 30 years and older were included. Patients were categorised into three groups based on their primary medical condition: neurological (n\u2009=\u200963), rheumatological (n\u2009=\u2009106), and gastrointestinal (n\u2009=\u200994). Data collected included: demographic information, cannabis dosage, Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content, cultivated variety preference (sativa vs. Indica), and method of consumption (smoking vs. oil). Statistical analyses were conducted using ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, chi-square, and t-tests to compare cannabis prescription patterns between disease and demographic groups. RESULTS: Significant differences in cannabis prescription patterns were observed across disease groups. Patients with gastrointestinal conditions were prescribed the highest mean monthly cannabis dose (22.26\u2009\u00b1\u200913.60\u00a0g), while those with neurological conditions had the highest oil consumption (31.75%). Sex-based differences were notable, with male patients being prescribed significantly higher doses of cannabis (25.48\u2009\u00b1\u200915.15\u00a0g) and higher THC content (14\u2009\u00b1\u20096.56%) compared to female patients (17.32\u2009\u00b1\u20099.93\u00a0g; THC: 11.39\u2009\u00b1\u20096.48%). DISCUSSION: The study highlights variations in cannabis prescription patterns based on both medical conditions and demographic factors. Male patients received higher doses and THC-rich formulations, while patients with gastrointestinal conditions had the highest cannabis prescription overall. These findings suggest the need for individualised cannabis therapy based on patient characteristics and the specific condition being treated. CONCLUSION: Medicinal cannabis usage patterns vary significantly across disease and demographic groups. Personalised cannabis treatment plans, informed by both clinical and demographic factors, are essential to optimising patient outcomes. Further research is needed to develop more precise guidelines for prescribing medicinal cannabis.",

    "abstract": "Natural variation in secondary metabolites is commonplace in organic matrices, including consumable fruits and vegetables. However, absolute concentration and variation of secondary metabolites are generally not of concern to consumers. Cannabis sativa and C. indica dried cannabis total Delta-9 Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is of importance to consumers/patients and must be accurately reported for both recreational and medical dried flower. In this report, the variation in Total THC in THC-dominant commercially relevant cultivars was investigated. The variation in Total THC values within different strata of the plant and between plants of the same batch were explored using a single analytical method. Within one stratum across nine batches (n\u2009=\u200927-57), Total THC varied by 3.1-6.7% of actual content, with only\u2009~\u200930-41% of individual replicates falling within their respective 99% confidence internal (CI) (representative of the batch mean). Between the top and bottom of plants across three batches, Total THC varied by 4.7-6.1% of actual THC content. Between plants of one cultivar, average Total THC varied by 2.8% which was statistically significant (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). Effect size (ES) measures were also reported for plant strata and plant against plant analysis. A comprehensive analysis of the extent of Total THC variation in samples of dried cannabis, evident both within and across plants of the same batch, has been presented using a random sampling and sample size calculated approach. Herein we demonstrate the natural variability present in dried cannabis flower using a single analytical method.",

    "abstract": "Cannabis use represents a significant risk factor for both psychotic disorders and suicidal behaviors, with growing evidence suggesting complex interactions between these variables. This systematic review examines the relationship between cannabis use and suicide risk in first-episode psychosis (FEP) patients, and explores underlying mechanisms, moderating factors, and intervention strategies. Following PRISMA guidelines, we analyzed 50 studies involving 12,764 FEP patients. Results demonstrate that cannabis use, especially high-potency cannabis used regularly, is associated with significantly increased suicide risk with studies consistently reporting elevated odds ratios (ranging from 1.43 to 1.84), and dose-dependent effects-daily use showing higher risk (studies reporting OR: 2.73, 95\u202f% CI: 1.89-3.94) and high-THC cannabis carrying greatest risk (OR: 3.12, 95\u202f% CI: 2.11-4.62). Multiple mechanisms mediate this relationship: neurobiological alterations in the endocannabinoid system, exacerbation of depressive symptoms, impaired cognitive functions, increased duration of untreated psychosis, and reduced treatment adherence. Key vulnerability factors include early-onset cannabis use (before age 15-16), female gender, history of childhood trauma, and comorbid psychiatric disorders. Critical high-risk periods were identified, particularly the first month after treatment initiation and following hospital discharge. Effective intervention strategies include integrated early intervention programs combining pharmacological treatment with psychosocial approaches, specifically cognitive-behavioral therapy, motivational interviewing, and family interventions. Emerging evidence suggests potential therapeutic benefits of CBD and specific risk management protocols. This review highlights the clinical importance of assessing cannabis use patterns in FEP patients and implementing targeted interventions during critical periods, particularly given the increasing availability of high-potency cannabis products globally.",

    "title": "Subsurface drip irrigation reduces weed infestation and irrigation water use while increasing inflorescence and cannabinoid yield in an outdoor tunnel Cannabis sativa L. production system.",
    "abstract": "Cannabis (Cannabis sativa L.) has served as a valuable medicinal plant for thousands of years and is experiencing a resurgence in cultivation and research due to recent legal changes. However, the resource-intensive nature of cannabis cultivation, particularly water and energy demands, poses significant environmental challenges. Outdoor cultivation in a semi-controlled environment can reduce those energy demands but necessitates irrigation. Drip irrigation (DI) is the most commonly used irrigation method but is often criticized for its susceptibility to water losses through evaporation and the risk of surface runoff. Subsurface Drip Irrigation (SDI) provides a sustainable solution by minimizing evaporation losses while maintaining or increasing yields, thereby enhancing water use efficiency. In this study, we compared the effects of DI and SDI on weed infestation, total water usage, inflorescence yield, and water use efficiency of three CBD-rich cannabis chemotype III genotypes (Kanada, Terra Italia, FED) in an outdoor foil tunnel cultivation system. SDI resulted in a reduction of irrigation water usage by 18.6% compared to DI. Remarkably, weed dry biomass was reduced by 93.2% in SDI. Concomitantly, inflorescence yield increased by 5% and CBD concentration by 9%. Overall, the water use efficiency of inflorescence yield and CBD concentration was significantly higher in SDI than in DI. Our results indicated that implementing SDI instead of DI can significantly decrease irrigation water use and reduce weed infestation while increasing inflorescence and CBD yield, thus reducing the environmental challenges associated with cannabis cultivation.",

    "abstract": "Alcohol use disorder (AUD) remains a pervasive public health issue with limited effective treatments. Cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychotropic constituent of cannabis, shows promise in modulating addictive behaviors. This study investigated the effects of chronic CBD administration on alcohol dependence, withdrawal symptoms, and neurodegeneration using two complementary rodent models: chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) exposure, which models established alcohol dependence, and ethanol vapor self-administration (EVSA), which captures the volitional aspects of alcohol intake. In the CIE model, CBD reduced alcohol self-administration during acute withdrawal without affecting alcohol metabolism or locomotor activity. CBD decreased motivation for alcohol, somatic withdrawal signs, withdrawal-induced anxiety-like behaviors, and mechanical sensitivity. During extinction, CBD attenuated alcohol-seeking behavior and stress-induced reinstatement. Electrophysiological recordings revealed that CBD reversed alcohol-induced decreases in neuronal excitability in the basolateral amygdala, suggesting a mechanism involving normalization of neural function. In the EVSA model, CBD reduced voluntary alcohol intake during the escalation phase, impacting voluntary alcohol intake. This effect was specific to alcohol-related behaviors, as it did not affect saccharin self-administration. Immunohistochemical analyses showed that CBD prevented alcohol-induced neurodegeneration in the nucleus accumbens shell and dorsomedial striatum, regions implicated in the volitional control of alcohol consumption. These findings indicate that chronic CBD administration attenuates both behavioral and neurobiological facets of alcohol dependence by modulating neuronal excitability and preventing neurodegeneration, supporting its therapeutic potential for AUD and providing mechanistic insights for future research.",

    "abstract": "The increase of \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in breath after cannabis inhalation has been well-documented in the forensic field, but the trends after ingestion of cannabis-infused edibles have not yet been investigated. In this study, participants ingested a cannabis-infused edible and provided breath samples before and at three timepoints after ingestion. Participants were assigned to one of two breath sampling devices. THC was found in most pre-use breath samples and THC concentration had variable trends after ingestion. Nineteen participants exhibited a maximum in their THC concentration at 47\u2009min, 92\u2009min, or 180\u2009min after ingestion, while six participants had their highest THC concentration before the observed ingestion and four participants had no significant change in THC concentration over the four samples. Five additional cannabinoids were detected in breath. While cannabidiol (CBD) trends followed THC trends for some participants, diverging trends in other participants suggest different biological processing of CBD derived from edibles. This proof-of-concept study shows that THC concentration in breath can increase after the ingestion of cannabis-infused edibles, but the uncertainty of breath measurements and a longer time window need to be further explored.",

    "abstract": "Cannabis use during pregnancy has recently become an important concern due to its increasing trend and association with neurodevelopmental alterations of exposed children. Although inhalation is the primary route of cannabis consumption in humans, few studies replicated this route in preclinical models of prenatal exposure. This study aimed to analyze the effects of chronic prenatal exposure to vaporized cannabis (PEVC) on hippocampal neurodevelopment, functionality, and learning and memory processes. Using a commercially available high-potency cannabis strain (THC 14.7%), pregnant rats were exposed to cannabis vapor from gestational day 8 to 21. A combination of primary hippocampal cultures, electrophysiological studies in slices, and behavioral tests was employed to assess the impact of PEVC. We found that PEVC induced presynaptic remodeling of hippocampal neurons in offspring under both basal and activity-dependent conditions by increasing synaptic vGlut1 abundance and the total recycling pool of synaptic vesicles. Chronic PEVC also induced a downregulation of CB1R at glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses. Additionally, an increase in axonal recruitment and synaptic efficacy was observed at hippocampal CA1 synapses of juvenile offspring. Moreover, long-lasting cognitive impairments were identified during adolescence, including deficits in spatial memory in male and female offspring. In summary, these findings demonstrate that exposure to high-potency cannabis vapor during pregnancy leads to significant changes in synaptic remodeling and efficacy, axonal recruitment, and long-term cognitive consequences in offspring.",

    "title": "Cannabidiol Induced Manic Episode: A Case Report.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cannabidiol (CBD), a non-intoxicating compound derived from Cannabis sativa, has gained widespread popularity for its proposed therapeutic effects in conditions such as anxiety, insomnia, and chronic pain. Unlike tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), CBD is often perceived as safe, with minimal psychoactive properties. However, its psychiatric safety profile, particularly in relation to mood disorders, remains poorly understood. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 31-year-old male with no prior psychiatric history who developed a manic episode characterized by irritability, decreased need for sleep, hyperactivity, and aggression. These symptoms emerged after three months of escalating daily CBD use via vaping, reaching high doses shortly before admission. Toxicology screening was negative for other substances, and the patient showed clinical improvement with mood stabilizers and antipsychotics following the discontinuation of CBD. DISCUSSION: This case raises concerns about the potential of high-dose CBD to induce manic symptoms in certain individuals. While CBD has been proposed to have anxiolytic and antipsychotic effects, its influence on mood regulation may be complex and dose-dependent. The variability in commercial CBD product composition, including possible contamination or mislabeling, further complicates risk assessment. Current evidence from clinical trials on CBD's effects in mood disorders is limited and inconclusive. CONCLUSION: Clinicians should remain alert to the psychiatric effects of CBD, particularly in patients presenting with new-onset mood symptoms. This report underscores the need for controlled studies to assess the safety of CBD in psychiatric populations and calls for stricter regulation of cannabinoid products.",

    "title": "Prevalence of THC-Positive Urine Drug Screens in Patients Receiving Chronic Opioid Therapy: A Retrospective Review.",
    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF STUDY: This retrospective review aimed to evaluate the prevalence of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-positive urine drug screens (UDS) in patients undergoing chronic opioid therapy (COT) for chronic pain at a single academic institution. With a growing national trend toward cannabis legalization and increased public access to marijuana for medical and recreational purposes, understanding the intersection between THC use and opioid prescribing practices is essential. The presence of THC on UDS has clinical, legal, and ethical implications, especially in regions where cannabis remains illegal. This study sought to quantify the prevalence of THC positivity in patients receiving COT for chronic pain. FINDINGS: A total of 244 UDS results were reviewed from January 1, 2024, to December 31, 2024. Among these, 24 patients (9.8%) tested positive for THC. Documentation and clinical responses to positive results varied, with some providers documenting patient counseling, while others did not acknowledge the result in the medical record. In a small subset of cases, positive THC findings contributed to changes in opioid therapy, including tapering or discontinuation. CONCLUSION: THC-positive UDS results are relatively common among patients receiving chronic opioid therapy, highlighting the increasing prevalence of cannabis use in this population. These findings align with prior literature and reinforce the need for individualized, non-punitive approaches to care. Routine screening, consistent documentation, and open communication about cannabis use are essential components of effective opioid risk stratification, safe prescribing practices, and informed treatment planning. These considerations are critical in regions where recreational marijuana remains illegal, which may further influence provider decision-making regarding ongoing opioid therapy.",

    "title": "Unravelling herbicide stress and its impact on metabolite profiling in Cannabis sativa: an investigative study.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cannabis sativa L., renowned for its versatility in pharmaceutical, textile, and cosmetic industries, is highly susceptible to several agronomic and environmental factors, particularly herbicides. These chemical agents, while commonly used for weed control, can adversely affect plant growth, physiology, and secondary metabolite production. Understanding the plant's response to such external stressors is essential for optimizing its cultivation and ensuring the quality of its bioactive compounds. METHODS: In our current work, we studied the impact of two herbicides- glyphosate and metribuzin on the morpho-physiological and biochemical characteristics of cannabis plants. The secondary metabolite production analysis was carried out using Gas Chromatography-Mass S pectrometry (GC-MS). Furthermore, in silico studies using molecular modelling and optimization via Density Functional Theory (DFT) were performed, followed by molecular docking. RESULTS: It was observed that both herbicides greatly impact overall plant productivity including primary and secondary metabolite production. Further, glyphosate treatment caused an increase in fatty acid synthesis while the contrary was observed in case of metribuzin. Also, herbicide stress leads to the synthesis of cannabidivarol and cannabidiol although they were absent in the untreated group. These findings provide crucial insights for optimizing agricultural practices in cannabis cultivation. Moreover, molecular simulation results showed that both metribuzin and glyphosate bind at the active pocket of Tetrahydrocannabinolic acid synthase (THCA synthase) and offer a mechanistic explanation for the observed variations in \u03949 -tetrahydocannabinol (THC) levels by suggesting that both herbicides inhibit THCA synthase activity, contributing to a deeper understanding of herbicide-plant interactions at the molecular level. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that herbicide stress impacts overall cannabis productivity and alters biosynthesis. The stress notably stimulates the production of cannabidivarol and cannabidiol. In addition, molecular docking studies revealed that metribuzin binds to the same active channel as Cannabigerolic acid (CBGA)- the THC precursor, while glyphosate binds at the entrance, thereby hindering THC production. This multifaceted approach guides sustainable farming strategies and has implications for manipulating cannabinoid profiles in pharmaceutical and other industrial applications.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Medicinal cannabis has mixed evidence for treating anxiety and depression, yet patients frequently use it as a treatment. This observational study evaluated the effects of medicinal cannabis initiation in adults with clinically significant anxiety and/or depression over a 6-month period. METHODS: Adults with clinically significant anxiety and/or depression initiating medicinal cannabis use in Maryland, USA completed ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and longitudinal follow-up evaluations. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) assessments were completed at baseline and 1, 3, and 6\u00a0months after medicinal cannabis initiation. EMA measures were completed at baseline and daily for 8\u00a0weeks after cannabis initiation with measures collected before each cannabis use and at time of expected peak effect. Changes in anxiety and depression were evaluated using linear mixed effect models. RESULTS: Significant decreases from baseline in anxiety and depression were observed, with mean scores dropping below clinically significant levels within three months of initiation. EMA data indicated that most participants selected THC-dominant cannabis and acute reductions in anxiety, depression, and perceived driving ability along with increased ratings of feeling \"high\". Acute effects were dose-dependent: 10-15\u00a0mg of oral THC and at least 3 puffs of vaporized cannabis yielded the most robust reductions in anxiety and depression. CONCLUSIONS: Initiation of THC-dominant medicinal cannabis was associated with acute reductions in anxiety and depression, and sustained reductions in overall symptom severity over a 6-month period. Controlled clinical trials are needed to further investigate the efficacy and safety of medicinal cannabis for acute anxiety and depression symptom management.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The safety of oral cannabidiol (CBD) and cannabidiolic acid (CBDA)-rich hemp oil supplementation in dogs with cancer receiving chemotherapy has not been investigated. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the safety, tolerability, and influence on doxorubicin exposure over time of oral CBD/CBDA-rich hemp oil supplementation in dogs diagnosed with high grade lymphoma undergoing CHOP chemotherapy. ANIMALS: Client-owned dogs diagnosed with lymphoma. METHODS: Dogs were enrolled in this prospective, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial to receive either CBD/CBDA-rich hemp oil capsules or placebo during one cycle of CHOP chemotherapy. Primary outcomes evaluated included adverse events during chemotherapy, quality of life scores and doxorubicin area under the curve (AUC) over a 5-week period. RESULTS: Twenty-five dogs were enrolled, with 19 completing the trial. CBD/CBDA supplementation did not significantly affect doxorubicin AUC in the intervention group. The doxorubicin AUC was not different between groups at week 0 [placebo 390.8\u2009nM/h (318.6-479.4); CBD/CBDA 403.4\u2009nM/h (351.9-462.5)] but was different at week 5 [placebo 572.6 (448.3-731.2); CBD/CBDA 406.8 (3.23.2-551.8)]. CBD/CBDA supplementation was well-tolerated, and no serious adverse events were observed. No significant differences between groups were observed in hematological and biochemical variables. The mean (range) quality of life scores for placebo and CBD were 7.56 (0, 35), and 10.75 (0, 56), respectively, with no significant differences. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Short-term oral CBD/CBDA-rich hemp supplementation appeared safe and well-tolerated in dogs undergoing CHOP chemotherapy for lymphoma.",

    "title": "Evaluating the impact of cannabis oil for autistic children with and without concomitant medications: Insights from an open-label study.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although only two drugs are FDA approved for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), clinical practice treatment includes off-label use of medications to address the troubling symptoms of ASD. Several trials showed the beneficial effects of medical cannabis for alleviating symptoms of ASD. However, data are lacking regarding its safety and effectiveness as a single agent compared to add-on therapy. AIMS: To compare the safety and effectiveness of medical cannabis as a monotherapy and add-on therapy in autistic children. METHODS: An open-label trial recruiting autistic children was performed and treated with medical cannabis oil with a THC:CBD ratio of 1:20, respectively. Tests were conducted at baseline and after 6\u2009months of therapy. A secondary analysis was done to compare physical and behavior parameters, using tests such as Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule and Wechsler tests in the two groups. RESULTS: Out of 109 participants, 81 completed the treatment. Thirty received cannabis as add-on therapy to a pre-existing treatment, whereas 51 received cannabis as monotherapy, with no observed differences in baseline characteristics between the groups. The mean maximal CBD dose was 3.1\u2009mg/kg/day in the monotherapy group, compared to 2.8\u2009mg/kg/day in the add-on group ( CONCLUSIONS: Add-on cannabis therapy is as safe as monotherapy treatment, without significant differences in efficacy.",

    "title": "Cannabis tolerance reduces symptom relief.",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: We measure for the first time how tolerance from repeated consumption of medical cannabis affects acute symptom management. METHODS: Using the Releaf App, medical cannabis patients recorded their symptoms, product type, cannabis consumption method, major cannabinoid levels, dosing patterns, and real-time symptom intensity levels prior to and following each cannabis administration session, as well as any side effects from usage. The sample consists of the first ten cannabis self-administration sessions recorded by 16,395 medical cannabis patients between 06/05/2016 and 09/19/22, yielding a sample of 120,691 symptom-specific treatment-level observations, recorded during 42,005 sessions. This study uses fixed effects least-squares regression analyses to analyze the effects of the session count on symptom relief. RESULTS: On average, people experienced a 0.5% decrease in symptom relief with each subsequent session (p < 0.001). Combustible products offered more therapeutic relief than vaping, eating or drinking; higher doses offered greater relief; and the reduction in symptom relief with subsequent usage was similar whether patients were treating pain, depression, or anxiety. Cannabis products' THC levels were positively associated with symptom relief; however, patients showed no changes in the THC levels of products with subsequent consumption. Patients increased the dose consumed as they completed more sessions. The results are robust to alternative treatment measures, including days since the first session was recorded. Subsample regressions indicate that experienced users drive most of the effects. Analyses assessing side effects show that factors, such as THC and dose, that increased symptom relief also increased side effects experienced. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: The findings suggest the majority of patients experience decreased symptom relief after repeated use of medical cannabis, counterbalanced by improvements in negative side effects. Of direct clinical relevance, THC levels and the dose can be adjusted to customize medical cannabis patient treatment, increase medication compliance, and improve treatment outcomes.",

    "title": "Cannabidiol interactions with \u0394-9-tetrahydrocannabinol on antinociception after carrageenan-induced inflammatory pain in male and female rats.",
    "abstract": "Cannabis products used for pain typically contain \u0394-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (\u03949-THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) in varied amounts, but data on the effects of specific cannabinoid formulations on different pain types are lacking. This study used the carrageenan-induced inflammatory pain model to test oral \u03949-THC, CBD, or their combination on acute edema and pain hypersensitivity. Male and female Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 10-14 per sex/group) were pretreated (1 hour) with vehicle (sesame oil), \u03949-THC (1, 3, and 10 mg/kg, p.o.), CBD (10, 30, 100 mg/kg, p.o.), or select doses of \u03949-THC + CBD combinations prior to an intraplantar \u03bb-carrageenan injection into the hind paw. The nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ketoprofen (10 and 20 mg/kg i.p.) or its vehicle (1:1:18 ethanol:Cremophor EL:saline [Millipor Sigma]) was administered to a separate group as a positive control. Measurements were conducted at baseline and 1, 3, and 5 hours after carrageenan injection. Carrageenan produced edema and hypersensitivity to radiant heat (hyperalgesia) and mechanical pressure (allodynia). \u03949-THC alone sex- and dose-dependently decreased hyperalgesia and allodynia but not inflammation, with effects of \u03949-THC being greater in females than males, and the lowest \u03949-THC dose was proinflammatory in males. CBD alone did not affect pain sensitivity but had modest anti-inflammatory effects in males. Isobolographic and dose addition analyses indicated \u03949-THC + CBD was subadditive relative to \u03949-THC alone. These data demonstrate that prophylactic oral \u03949-THC alleviates acute inflammatory pain with sex-dependent effects, and CBD diminishes \u03949-THC antinociception when combined. The findings suggest oral \u03949-THC is superior to CBD or combined \u03949-THC + CBD for acute inflammatory pain. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Despite the popularity of cannabis for pain management, empirical data on how specific cannabinoid formulations affect acute inflammatory pain are limited. This study in rats found that pure \u0394-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (\u03949-THC) formulations were most effective at improving inflammatory pain compared to pure cannabidiol or \u03949-THC + cannabidiol combinations, and females were more sensitive than males to the antinociceptive effects of \u03949-THC.",
