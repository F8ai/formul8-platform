      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use is prevalent among young adults, yet cessation treatment options are limited and underutilized. METHODS: Wisconsin residents aged 18 to 24 who had vaped nicotine in the past month (N\u2009=\u2009480) completed an online survey assessing vaping initiation, past quit experiences, future quit intentions, and treatment knowledge and preferences. The survey also assessed perceived physical and mental health harms of vaping nicotine and other products (eg, cannabis, cannabidiol). RESULTS: Most young adults had made a prior e-cigarette quit attempt, commonly motivated by concerns about addiction, cost, and health problems. Though 80% want support to quit, preferred methods of support were highly variable. The same methods (eg, medication, friends/family, health care provider, therapist) that were most endorsed as the form of support young adults were most likely to use were also among the most endorsed forms of support that young adults would not want to use. Nearly 40% of participants reported vaping cannabis and perceived vaping cannabis as significantly less harmful than vaping nicotine or tobacco for physical and mental health. CONCLUSIONS: Vaping cessation resources that are responsive to young adults' needs and preferences are needed. The high variability in treatment preferences suggests that multiple strategies need to be offered; there is no one-size-fits-all approach. Cannabis vaping is prevalent, and an important area for future research is to examine the impact of cannabis vaping on nicotine vaping dependence, cessation, and treatment use. Strategies to reach, motivate, and engage young adults in e-cigarette cessation and cessation treatment should highlight their concerns about addiction, costs, health harms, and desired treatment options.",

      "title": "[The cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome-A narrative review].",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Until 25\u00a0years ago cyclic vomiting attacks under the chronic influence of cannabis were virtually unknown. Following the legalization of non-medical cannabis in North America and the associated increase in cannabis use, including high-potency strains, the number of patients there with cannabis-related cyclic vomiting is increasing. The ROME-IV criteria now define cannabis-induced cyclic vomiting as cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS). This review aims to provide information about CHS, as an increase in cases is also to be expected in Germany following legalization. METHOD: Selective review article. RESULTS: The CHS is most frequently registered in emergency departments. A\u00a0clear differentiation between CHS and cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS), in which one third of those affected also regularly use cannabis, is only possible by establishing full remission during a\u00a06-12\u00a0month cannabis abstinence. Therefore, mixed forms of CVS and CHS are initially seen in emergency departments (suspected CHS), also with hidden life-threatening abdominal comorbidities. Severe vomiting can also lead to serious complications. The commonly used antiemetics often do not help. Hot showers and baths as well as i.m. haloperidol (5\u202fmg) can provide acute relief from severe vomiting. Rubbing the abdomen with 0.075-0.1% capsaicin cream also has an antiemetic effect but less quickly. DISCUSSION: In ROME-IV the CHS is nosologically considered a\u00a0special variant of CVS. In particular, it is a\u00a0specific cannabis-related, often severe physical disorder. As healing can only be achieved through sustained cannabis abstinence, suspected CHS in emergency departments is an interdisciplinary challenge for gastroenterology, neuropsychiatry and the addiction support system.",

      "abstract": "Cannabis use is increasingly prevalent among individuals with epilepsy, yet its impact on seizure control remains poorly understood. While cannabidiol (CBD) has demonstrated antiseizure properties and gained FDA approval for specific epileptic syndromes, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive compound in cannabis, may alter neuronal excitability and potentially exacerbate seizure activity. We present two illustrative case reports of male patients with focal epilepsy and chronic cannabis use who underwent treatment with antiseizure medications and responsive neurostimulation (RNS). In both cases, cannabis use was temporally associated with breakthrough seizures and poor seizure control. These cases highlight the complex and multifactorial relationship between cannabis use and seizure outcomes, including potential pharmacokinetic interactions with antiseizure medications (ASM) and the possibility that cannabis may blunt the neuromodulation effects of RNS. Given the retrospective data and limited detail on cannabis use, these findings should be interpreted with caution. As cannabis use rises among individuals with epilepsy, further research is needed to clarify its potential effects on seizures and treatment response, including neuromodulation.",

This study investigates the perceptions, consumption patterns, and reported outcomes of cannabis and cannabidiol (CBD) oil use among IBD patients and controls. METHODS: A 37-question survey was administered to 139 participants (IBD patients,  RESULTS: Cannabis consumption was higher in IBD patients (57, 53.8%) than controls (15, 45.5%) with both groups strongly supporting medical cannabis use (IBD; 92, 86.8% vs. controls; 29, 84.9%). Most IBD patients believed cannabis (67, 63.2%), CBD oil (60, 56.6%), corticosteroids (77, 73.3%), and biologics/immunosuppressants (85, 81.0%) had a somewhat-extremely beneficial effect in relieving IBD symptoms. Over 50% of IBD cannabis users reported relief from abdominal pain, other pain, stress, anxiety, depression, and nausea/vomiting, with Crohn's disease patients experiencing significantly more relief than ulcerative colitis patients for certain symptoms ( CONCLUSIONS: Consumption of cannabis and CBD oil was perceived as beneficial for relieving IBD, with many reporting significant symptom relief from using these substances. The strong support of cannabis and CBD oil as medical treatments and therapeutic effects highlights the potential for cannabis and CBD oil as treatments in IBD.",

      "abstract": "Prevalence rates for substance exposure during pregnancy are increasing, with cannabis emerging as one of the most common substances used. Infants with prenatal cannabis exposure face a greater risk of neurobehavioral vulnerabilities. The current study sought to examine the association between prenatal cannabis exposure and newborn neurobehavior, while also considering potential moderators (i.e., tobacco exposure and household income). The study included 115 pregnant individuals and their newborns enrolled in the Atlanta African American Maternal-Child cohort. Researchers quantitatively measured biomarkers of cannabis (COOH-THC) and tobacco smoke (COT) in urine samples collected at enrollment. Self-reported substance use was also collected during the first trimester of pregnancy. Newborn neurobehavior was assessed at 1\u00a0month of age (M\u00a0=\u00a025.3 days' old, SD\u00a0=\u00a014.41) using the NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scale. There were no significant main effects of self-reported prenatal cannabis use or prenatal COOH-THC concentrations on newborn neurobehavior. Additionally, tobacco exposure did not moderate these associations. Significant interactions were found between household income and prenatal COOH-THC levels in predicting newborn attention and arousal. Specifically, cannabis-exposed newborns exhibited attenuated attention and heightened arousal if they were from low-income households. Our findings highlight the potential role that socioeconomic factors may play in influencing behavior associated with prenatal exposures.",

      "title": "Association of Smoking Cannabis With Cardiovascular Events Among Veterans With Coronary Artery Disease.",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Whether cannabis is a risk factor for cardiovascular events is unknown. We examined the association between smoking cannabis and cardiovascular events in a cohort of older veterans (66 to 68 years of age) with coronary artery disease. METHODS: The THC Cohort (Heart and Cannabis) comprised 4285 veterans (mean [SD] age, 67.5 [1.01] years; 2% female) with coronary artery disease who were born in 1950 to 1952. Participants were recruited between April 5, 2018, and March 12, 2020, interviewed about health behaviors, and then classified according to their self-reported cannabis smoking status in the previous 30 days. In a separate analysis, we classified participants according to any form of cannabis use (smoking, vaping, or edible use) versus nonuse in the past 30 days. Data on demographic, behavioral, and clinical characteristics were collected by telephone interview and from national Department of Veterans Affairs and Medicare data sources. The primary outcome included a composite of fatal and nonfatal stroke, fatal and nonfatal acute myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular death. The follow-up period for each patient extended from the date of their initial interview until the end of study (June 14, 2022). All participants were followed until they experienced an outcome or until the end of the follow-up period. Survey nonresponse weights and propensity score-based weights were used to reduce bias and confounding. Hazard ratios were estimated using cause-specific hazard models. RESULTS: The cohort included 1015 veterans with coronary artery disease who reported smoking cannabis in the previous 30 days and 3122 veterans who did not smoke cannabis in the previous 30 days. Mean follow-up was 3.3 years, and 563 events occurred. Compared with veterans who did not smoke cannabis, smoking cannabis (past 30 days) was not associated with the composite outcome of acute myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.61-1.24]). Similarly, use of any form of cannabis (smoking, vaping, dabbing, edibles) in the past 30 days was not associated with the composite outcome. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of older veterans with coronary artery disease, self-reported cannabis use was not independently associated with increased cardiovascular events over a mean of 3.3 years of follow-up.",

      "abstract": "Despite the widespread use of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) as the gold standard for dopamine (DA) replacement in Parkinson's Disease (PD), its prolonged administration frequently leads to L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID), a significant therapeutic challenge. Modulating the endocannabinoid system has emerged as a promising approach for managing LID. This study explored whether cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive compound of Cannabis sativa, and PECS-101, a fluorinated derivative of CBD, could mitigate the onset and progression of LID. We used unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats, treated with L-DOPA (10\u202fmg\u202fkg\u202f-\u202f1) for three weeks to induce severe abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs). Treatments were administered during the final two weeks. CBD (30\u202fmg\u202fkg\u202f-\u202f1) and PECS-101 (3 and 30\u202fmg\u202fkg\u202f-\u202f1) significantly reduced AIMs without impairing the motor benefits of L-DOPA. The antidyskinetic effects of CBD were associated with decreased striatal Fos-B and phospho-ERK expression and were independent of lesion severity. CBD effects were prevented by antagonists of CB1 (1\u202fmg\u202fkg\u202f-\u202f1) and PPAR\u03b3 (4\u202fmg\u202fkg\u202f-\u202f1) receptors. Co-administration of TRPV-1 antagonist capsazepine (5\u202fmg\u202fkg\u202f-\u202f1) enhanced the antidyskinetic effects of CBD. Combining the capsazepine with the neuronal nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, 7-nitroimidazole (10\u202fmg\u202fkg\u202f-\u202f1) enhanced these effects. CBD did not alter striatal DA levels but significantly increased the concentrations of anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol in dyskinetic animals. The antidyskinetic effects of CBD were associated with a reduction of the enhanced striatal glia and peripheral inflammation markers. These findings suggest that CBD alleviates LID by interacting with the nitrergic neurotransmission and TRPV-1, CB1, and PPAR\u03b3 receptors.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Polysubstance use-use of more than one substance- is prevalent and an emergent public health issue. Yet not much is known about factors associated with same-day polysubstance use among adolescents. This study examined correlates of same-day tobacco and cannabis use/co-use among adolescents who use tobacco/cannabis. METHODS: Cross-sectional data were from 10th and 11th grade students (n=536) who reported tobacco/cannabis use. Regression models were used to examine intrapersonal, psychological (anxiety, depression), societal (societal concern, discrimination), and environmental (public and home secondhand smoke/vape exposure) correlates of past 30-day usage frequency (no, infrequent, and frequent use) of same-day: poly-product use (poly-tobacco/nicotine [use of different types of nicotine/tobacco]; poly-cannabis [use of different types of or marijuana/THC]); poly-drug use [tobacco/nicotine and marijuana/THC], and nicotine and THC vape mixing. RESULTS: Participants were predominantly Hispanic (66.23%) and male (62.50%). Among participants, 8.58%, reported frequent same-day poly-tobacco use, 13.81% frequent same-day poly-cannabis use, 13.25% frequent same-day poly-drug use, and 3.36% vape mixing. Past 30-day alcohol use was associated with higher odds (1.88-8.31, p<.05) of infrequent and frequent same day use of all study outcomes except vape mixing. Secondhand smoke/vapor exposure was consistently associated with higher odds (1.13-1.26, p<.05) of infrequent/frequent same day use. Discrimination increased the odds of some same-day polysubstance use while societal concerns had inconsistent effects across study outcomes. CONCLUSION: A significant proportion of adolescents who use tobacco/cannabis products might engage in high-risk use patterns. Alcohol use, societal, and environmental factors significantly increase the likelihood of same-day poly-use of tobacco and cannabis products.",

      "title": "Synaptic signatures of perinatal cannabinoids: A systematic review of rodent hippocampal synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory.",
      "abstract": "The expanding legalization of cannabis raises significant public health concerns about its use during pregnancy, particularly due to the limited understanding of its impact on neurodevelopment. Existing research suggests that perinatal cannabis or cannabinoid exposure may impair learning and memory; however, variations in study design hinder the ability to draw generalizable conclusions. Clinical studies are limited in their observational nature and the lack of insight into neural or cellular mechanisms underlying cognitive changes, underscoring the importance of preclinical studies to explore the effects of perinatal cannabinoids in greater detail. The objective of this systematic review is to consolidate findings from existing preclinical research that investigates the effects of perinatal cannabinoid exposure on learning and memory and the putative mechanism of learning and memory, hippocampal synaptic plasticity, in rodents. This review summarizes studies on hippocampal synaptic plasticity (n\u2009=\u20092), spatial/visual memory (n\u2009=\u200913), working memory (n\u2009=\u20096), recognition memory (n\u2009=\u200912), and associative memory (n\u2009=\u20097). Perinatal cannabinoid-induced impairments were reported in the two synaptic plasticity studies, and in 24 out of 30 studies that examined learning and memory, with spatial memory tasks showing the most consistent deficits. While the existing evidence converges on the notion that perinatal cannabinoid exposure negatively impacts hippocampal physiology and associated memory functions, further research is needed to disentangle the influence of various methodological factors, including offspring sex and age, cannabinoid type, time of gestational exposure, and method of administration.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Cannabis use among U.S. older adults has risen rapidly over the past two decades. This study examined the changes in and correlates of cannabis-involved substance use treatment admissions among this demographic. METHODS: Using the 2000-2021 concatenated Treatment Episode Data Set-Admissions (TEDS-A) age 50+ ( RESULTS: During the study period, the number of cannabis-involved admissions increased substantially, while their share of all admissions increased and then decreased as other drug-related admissions increased. The annual percentage changes (APC) show that the shares of cannabis-involved admissions of all admissions between 2000 and 2012 increased for the 50-64 age group and then decreased between 2012 and 2021. In the 65+ age group, the shares increased between 2000 and 2016 (APC=5.2) and then plateaued. Compared to no-cannabis admissions, the likelihood (relative risk ratio) of all cannabis-involved admissions was higher among males, black people, residents of states where medical or recreational cannabis use was legal, and referrals from healthcare providers and court/criminal legal systems. The likelihood (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]) of cannabis-primary admissions was higher among those age 65+ (aOR=1.04, 95%CI=1.00-1.08), black people (aOR=1.34, 95% CI=1.32-1.36), Hispanic people (aOR=1.26, 95% CI=1.23-1.29), residents of states with medical cannabis laws, and those who were referred by healthcare providers and legal systems. IMPLICATIONS: Cannabis-involved admissions are projected to continue to increase as cannabis use continues to increase. More effective regulations and enforcement of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol potency and research on cannabis harms and poly-substance use are needed to protect the health of older adults who turn to cannabis for its purported health benefits. Increased availability and accessibility of treatment infrastructure are also needed.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The efficacy of medical cannabis in alleviating pain has been demonstrated in clinical trials, yet questions remain regarding the extent to which specific chemical compounds contribute to analgesia versus expectation-based (placebo) responses. Effective blinding is notoriously difficult in cannabis trials, complicating the identification of compound-specific effects. METHODS: In a prospective study of 329 chronic pain patients (40% females; aged 48.9\u2009\u00b1\u200915.5) prescribed medical cannabis, we examined whether the chemical composition of cannabis cultivars could predict treatment outcomes. We used a Random Forest classifier with nested cross-validation to assess the predictive value of demographics, clinical features, and approximately 200 chemical compounds. Model robustness was evaluated using six additional machine learning algorithms. RESULTS: Here we show that incorporating chemical composition markedly improves the prediction of pain relief (AUC\u2009=\u20090.63\u2009\u00b1\u20090.10) compared to models using only demographic and clinical features (AUC\u2009=\u20090.52\u2009\u00b1\u20090.09; p\u2009<\u20090.001). This result is consistent across all models tested. While well-known cannabinoids such as THC and CBD provide limited predictive value, specific terpenoids, particularly \u03b1-Bisabolol and eucalyptol, emerge as key predictors of treatment response. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that pain relief can be predicted from cannabis chemical profiles that are unknown to patients, providing evidence for compound-specific therapeutic effects. These results highlight the importance of considering the full range of cannabis compounds when developing more precise and effective cannabis-based therapies for pain management.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alcohol and delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) (main impairing ingredient of cannabis) are both crash contributors that interfere with motor vehicle operation. However, the relationship between drug concentration and crash injury severity is unclear for either drug. We aim to clarify the relationship between blood alcohol concentration (BAC) and crash injury severity, based on healthcare system utilisation, with and without THC. METHODS: The National Drug Driving Study is an ongoing prospective study involving 17 Canadian trauma centres. Eligible subjects included drivers aged 16+ who visited a participating trauma centre and had blood drawn as part of routine care within 6\u2009hours of a crash. Deidentified blood samples were tested for alcohol and THC using gas chromatography-flame ionisation detection and liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. Study outcomes included admission to hospital and admitted patients' length of hospital stay. RESULTS: 10\u2009322 injured drivers visited a participating trauma centre between 2018 and 2023. 1649 (16.0%), 1716 (16.6%) and 463 (4.5%) drivers had detectable levels of alcohol, THC or both, respectively. Compared with sober drivers (BAC=0), drivers with 0%<BAC<0.08% had increased odds of admission (aOR=1.69, 95%\u2009CI=1.31 to 2.19), as did drivers with BAC\u22650.08% (aOR=1.36, 95%\u2009CI=1.16 to 1.60). THC did not modify the relationship between alcohol and admission. Neither alcohol nor THC predicted were associated with length of stay following admission. INTERPRETATION: Alcohol increases hospital admissions after crashes but does not have a dose-response relationship with admission or length of stay. THC does not moderate this relationship.",

Today, a wide variety of cannabis products and alternatives are available in the legal and illicit markets. Harms associated with their use may vary depending on the amount and type of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) they contain. Few studies have examined the awareness of and use of these different cannabis products among adolescents. METHODS: Our study examined patterns of cannabis use in adolescent patients of an urban pediatric addiction clinic. RESULTS: Most adolescents seen at the clinic use multiple cannabis products, and many adolescents use cannabinoid derivatives such as delta-8 and delta-10 THC. DISCUSSION: These results highlight the need for providers to explore in depth the various cannabis products used by adolescents, educate adolescents on the products, especially due to unknown risks associated with cannabinoid derivatives, and advocate for further regulation of alternative cannabis products.",

      "abstract": "Cannabis use during pregnancy is increasing, often to alleviate stress and anxiety, yet the long-term effect of prenatal cannabis exposure alone or in combination with psychosocial stress on offspring neurodevelopment or maternal behaviors remains unclear. Here, we developed a translational rodent model combining prenatal \u0394\u2079-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) exposure with chronic psychosocial stress using the maternal witness defeat stress (MWDS) paradigm. Pregnant C57BL/6 mice were exposed to MWDS from gestational day (GD) 3-12 and received daily subcutaneous THC (2 mg/kg) or vehicle until birth. All exposure groups showed impaired maternal behavior, with negative postnatal outcomes and caregiving, with additive effects observed in the combined exposure group. In adolescence, male and female offspring exhibited exposure-specific behavioral alterations. Prenatal stress and combined exposures led to increased anxiety-like behavior and reduced motivated behavior in both sexes, while THC alone primarily impacted female self-care and social behavior. Transcriptomic profiling of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) of adolescent offspring revealed sex- and region-specific gene expression changes across all exposure groups. Prenatal THC-, stress-, and combined exposures each altered distinct molecular pathways related to mitochondrial function, synaptic organization, and glial signaling. Comparative analysis with a perinatal fentanyl model revealed shared transcriptional substrates involved in synaptic signaling and circadian regulation. These findings indicate that THC and stress independently and additively impair maternal behaviors with lasting neurodevelopment signatures in offspring.",

The objective of this study is to assess risk perceptions of cannabis and CBD use during pregnancy among pregnant and non-pregnant patients. METHODS: The study design is multi-method; a cross-sectional survey assessing use behaviors and risk perceptions is supplemented with qualitative focus group discussions (FGDs). Recruitment for surveys was from outpatient obstetrics clinics and recruitment for FGDs was from the same clinics and a substance-use treatment clinic, from October 2022 to February 2023. The survey instrument was developed via combining question items from validated instruments that assess cannabis and CBD use and risk perceptions. Comparisons of response frequency distributions for pregnant versus non-pregnant participants were calculated with chi-square analysis for individual risk perception question items. Data from the FGDs were coded and analyzed via a deductive content analysis approach. RESULTS: There were 261 survey respondents and 5 FGDs ( CONCLUSION: Findings indicate uncertainty of risk related to cannabis and CBD use during pregnancy regardless of current pregnancy or lactation status, despite prevalent ever use of cannabis and CBD in those who were pregnant. This suggests an urgent need for clearer risk communication about cannabis and CBD use in pregnancy.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Cannabis-based products for medicinal use, also referred to as cannabinoid-containing products, particularly those containing cannabidiol as the primary active constituent, have shown to be a possible alternative in treating various health conditions in companion animals. Thus, this systematic review aims to synthesise and analyse the available data on the efficacy/effectiveness and safety of cannabis-based products for medicinal use in dogs and cats to assist in clinical decision-making. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review was conducted across PubMed, LILACS, Scopus, and Google Scholar from February 2014 to February 2024. The search strategy included both MeSH terms and free-text keywords related to medical cannabis, including Medical Marijuana, Cannabis and Cannabaceae, combined with terms referring to domestic cats and dogs. Additionally, title/abstract keywords, including Cannab (as a truncated term), were used to retrieve literature on cannabinoids and their therapeutic applications. RESULTS: Twenty-two articles were identified examining cannabidiol-based formulations for osteoarthritis, epilepsy, atopic dermatitis, postsurgical pain, and behavioural issues. Cannabis-based products for medicinal use with cannabidiol as the primary active constituent demonstrated improvements in pain, behaviour, and seizures, with no serious adverse events. However, research on their use in cats is limited to two studies. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: While promising, the long-term efficacy/effectiveness, optimal dosages, and safety of cannabis-based products for medicinal use remain unclear. Further studies are needed to confirm their therapeutic potential and ensure safe veterinary use.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common liver disorder caused by oxidative stress and dysregulation of lipid metabolism. The endocannabinoid system (ECS), particularly the type 1 cannabinoid (CB1) receptor, plays a crucial role in NAFLD progression. Cannabinoids, such as cannabidiol (CBD) and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), along with terpenes, such as beta-myrcene and d-limonene, have shown potential therapeutic effects on liver health, particularly in reducing oxidative stress and modulating lipid metabolism. This study aimed to analyse the effects of five cannabis oils (COs), each with different CBD:THC ratios and terpenes content, on hypertension, dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis, oxidative stress, and CB1 receptor expression in an experimental model of NAFLD induced by a sucrose-rich diet (SRD) in Wistar rats for 3 weeks. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were fed either a: (1) reference diet (RD; standard commercial laboratory diet) or a: (2) sucrose-rich diet (SRD) for 3 weeks. 3 to 7 SRD\u2009+\u2009CO as following: (3) SRD\u2009+\u2009THC; (4) SRD\u2009+\u2009CBD; (5) SRD\u2009+\u2009CBD:THC 1:1; (6) SRD\u2009+\u2009CBD:THC 2:1; and (7) SRD\u2009+\u2009CBD:THC 3:1. The COs were administered orally at a dose of 1.5\u00a0mg total cannabinoids/kg body weight daily. The cannabinoid and terpenes content of all COs used in the study was determined. The terpenes found in COs were beta-myrcene, d-limonene, terpinolene, linalool, beta-caryophyllene, alpha-humulene, (-)-guaiol, (-)-alpha-bisabolol. During the experimental period, body weight, food intake and blood pressure were measured. Serum glucose, triglyceride, total cholesterol, uric acid, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (AP) levels were evaluated. Liver tissue histology, NAFLD activity score (NAS), triglyceride and cholesterol content, lipogenic enzyme activities, enzyme related to mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, reactive oxygen species (ROS), thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS), and antioxidant enzyme activities were also evaluated. The CB1 receptor expression was also determined. RESULTS: The results showed that SRD-fed rats developed hypertension, dyslipidemia, liver damage, hepatic steatosis, lipid peroxidation, and oxidative stress. This was accompanied by upregulation of liver CB1 receptor expression. CBD-rich CO, CBD:THC 1:1 ratio CO; CBD:THC 2:1 ratio CO and CBD:THC 3:1 ratio CO showed antihypertensive properties. THC-rich CO, CBD:THC 1:1 ratio CO; CBD:THC 2:1 ratio CO showed the greatest beneficial effects against hepatic steatosis and liver damage. All COs exhibited antioxidant effects in liver tissue. This was associated with normal liver CB1 receptor expression. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that COs, particularly THC-rich CO, CBD:THC ratio 1:1 CO, CBD:THC ratio 2:1 CO and terpenes, can effectively reduce dyslipidemia, liver damage and hepatic steatosis in SRD-induced NAFLD. COs with a higher proportion of CBD in their composition showed antihypertensive properties. All the COs exhibited antioxidant properties. These findings suggest that COs, especially those with CBD:THC ratios of 1:1 and 2:1 and terpenes, may represent a promising therapeutic approach for managing NAFLD and preventing its progression to more severe liver disease.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Cystic echinococcosis is a parasitic zoonosis caused by the larval stage of Echinococcus granulosus sensu lato. Albendazole (ABZ) is the drug of choice, although its efficacy is variable. The present research aimed to assess the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of a full-spectrum extract of Cannabis sativa inflorescences against E. granulosus sensu stricto (s.s.). METHODS: Protoscoleces and cysts were incubated in vitro with the C. sativa extract, achieving final CBD concentrations of 1, 5, 10, and 50\u00a0\u00b5g/ml. Viability was evaluated periodically. Structural and ultrastructural alterations were also recorded. For the clinical efficacy study, female CF-1 mice were infected. Six months later, mice were divided into groups (n\u2009=\u200910): (a) water control; (b) ABZ; (c) C. sativa extract, and (d) ABZ\u2009+\u2009C. sativa extract. Treatments were administered every 24\u00a0h for 30 days. The efficacy of the treatments was evaluated according to the weight of the cysts collected and the ultrastructural alterations observed. RESULTS: The C. sativa extract caused a significant decrease in the viability of protoscoleces and cysts in vitro. The greatest effect was observed with 50\u00a0\u00b5g/ml, which generated the reduction in protoscoleces viability to 0% between 6 and 24\u00a0h post-incubation (pi) and the collapse of 92\u2009\u00b1\u200913% of the cysts after 24\u00a0h pi. All the in vivo treatments reduced the weight of the cysts and caused ultrastructural alterations, especially the combination of ABZ\u2009+\u2009C. sativa extract. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of a full-spectrum extract of C. sativa inflorescences against E. granulosus s.s.",

      "title": "In Silico Assessment of Cannabidiol From Cannabis sativa as an Antiviral Agent Against Key Shrimp Pathogens in Aquaculture.",
      "abstract": "Shrimp aquaculture plays a crucial role in global food production but is increasingly threatened by viral and microsporidian pathogens such as White Spot Syndrome Virus (WSSV), Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei (EHP) and Infectious Hypodermal and Haematopoietic Necrosis Virus (IHHNV). Conventional reliance on antibiotics to combat these infections has raised serious concerns regarding antimicrobial resistance, environmental contamination and food safety. Additionally, environmental stressors such as salinity shifts and poor water quality exacerbate disease outbreaks, leading to severe production losses across Asia and Latin America. To explore eco-friendly therapeutic alternatives, this study assessed the antiviral potential of cannabidiol (CBD), a bioactive compound extracted from Cannabis sativa seed oil, identified through GC-MS analysis. Using molecular docking techniques, we evaluated CBD's interactions with key viral proteins: VP28 of WSSV, the tubulin \u03b2-chain of EHP and the capsid protein of IHHNV. The docking results revealed strong binding affinities of -6.61\u2009kcal/mol (EHP), -6.72\u2009kcal/mol (IHHNV) and -5.38\u2009kcal/mol (WSSV), indicating stable and potentially inhibitory interactions. Structural models were retrieved from RCSB PDB and SwissModel, while ligand preparation and docking were performed using AutoDock 4.2. CBD also demonstrated favourable pharmacokinetic and safety profiles, with predictions indicating no mutagenicity, hepatotoxicity or cardiotoxicity, and acceptable drug-likeness characteristics. Compared to other plant-derived compounds previously tested in shrimp disease models, CBD exhibited superior binding stability, more interaction residues and better bioavailability scores. These findings highlight CBD as a promising dual-function agent, capable of both modulating shrimp immunity and directly inhibiting key viral pathogens. These findings highlight cannabidiol (CBD) as a promising dual-action compound, with the potential to both enhance shrimp immune responses and exert direct antiviral effects against key pathogens. This study lays a robust groundwork for future in\u00a0vivo validations, formulation strategies and regulatory frameworks, ultimately supporting the development of sustainable, precision-based aquaculture health management.",

We highlighted GTPase KRas and hematopoietic cell kinase (HCK) as very promising potential targets due to favorable docking scores with almost all investigated cannabinoids. We also find multiple matrix metalloproteinases among the top targets, suggesting possible novel therapeutic opportunities in rheumatic diseases. An analysis of inverse molecular docking fingerprints shows similar binding patterns for cannabinoids with similar structures, minor structural differences still suffice to change the affinity to specific targets. Hierarchical clustering of inverse molecular docking fingerprints revealed two main clusters in protein binding pattern similarity, the first encompassing THC-class and similar cannabinoids, as well as CBL-class cannabinoids, while the second contained CBD, CBC, and CBG-class cannabinoids. Notably, CBL-class cannabinoids exhibited binding patterns more similar to THC-class cannabinoids than their CBC-class precursors, possibly offering potential therapeutic benefits akin to THC with fewer psychotropic effects. DISCUSSION: This study highlights the therapeutic potential of minor cannabinoids and identifies their potential novel protein targets. Moreover, we demonstrate the utility of inverse molecular docking fingerprinting with clustering to identify compounds with similar binding patterns as well as identify pharmacophore-related compounds in a structurally agnostic manner, paving the way for future drug discovery and development.",

However, CBD crosses the placenta and accumulates in the fetal brain, where it can activate or repress the function of several molecular targets that are important for brain development. While consumption of high doses of CBD during pregnancy have been shown to disrupt offspring neurodevelopment and postnatal behavior, lower, more clinically relevant doses have not been assessed. Here, we show that oral consumption of 10 mg/kg/day CBD during pregnancy increases thermal pain sensitivity in exposed male mouse offspring. Additionally, we find that the same dose impairs cognition and reduces excitability of the prefrontal cortex in exposed female mouse offspring. These data show that lower doses of CBD consumption during pregnancy can impair fetal brain development and postnatal behavior.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The use of medicinal cannabis is increasing worldwide and has applications in managing a wide range of conditions, including neurological, rheumatological, and gastrointestinal diseases. Despite its growing prevalence, there are limited data on patterns of cannabis prescription across varying disease groups and demographic subgroups. METHODS: This retrospective observational cohort study analysed cannabis usage patterns among 263 patients from the cannabis user clinic at Rabin Medical center (RMC), a tertiary hospital in Israel. To minimise the inclusion of recreational cannabis users, only patients aged 30 years and older were included. Patients were categorised into three groups based on their primary medical condition: neurological (n\u2009=\u200963), rheumatological (n\u2009=\u2009106), and gastrointestinal (n\u2009=\u200994). Data collected included: demographic information, cannabis dosage, Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content, cultivated variety preference (sativa vs. Indica), and method of consumption (smoking vs. oil). Statistical analyses were conducted using ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, chi-square, and t-tests to compare cannabis prescription patterns between disease and demographic groups. RESULTS: Significant differences in cannabis prescription patterns were observed across disease groups. Patients with gastrointestinal conditions were prescribed the highest mean monthly cannabis dose (22.26\u2009\u00b1\u200913.60\u00a0g), while those with neurological conditions had the highest oil consumption (31.75%). Sex-based differences were notable, with male patients being prescribed significantly higher doses of cannabis (25.48\u2009\u00b1\u200915.15\u00a0g) and higher THC content (14\u2009\u00b1\u20096.56%) compared to female patients (17.32\u2009\u00b1\u20099.93\u00a0g; THC: 11.39\u2009\u00b1\u20096.48%). DISCUSSION: The study highlights variations in cannabis prescription patterns based on both medical conditions and demographic factors. Male patients received higher doses and THC-rich formulations, while patients with gastrointestinal conditions had the highest cannabis prescription overall. These findings suggest the need for individualised cannabis therapy based on patient characteristics and the specific condition being treated. CONCLUSION: Medicinal cannabis usage patterns vary significantly across disease and demographic groups. Personalised cannabis treatment plans, informed by both clinical and demographic factors, are essential to optimising patient outcomes. Further research is needed to develop more precise guidelines for prescribing medicinal cannabis.",

However, absolute concentration and variation of secondary metabolites are generally not of concern to consumers. Cannabis sativa and C. indica dried cannabis total Delta-9 Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is of importance to consumers/patients and must be accurately reported for both recreational and medical dried flower. In this report, the variation in Total THC in THC-dominant commercially relevant cultivars was investigated. The variation in Total THC values within different strata of the plant and between plants of the same batch were explored using a single analytical method. Within one stratum across nine batches (n\u2009=\u200927-57), Total THC varied by 3.1-6.7% of actual content, with only\u2009~\u200930-41% of individual replicates falling within their respective 99% confidence internal (CI) (representative of the batch mean). Between the top and bottom of plants across three batches, Total THC varied by 4.7-6.1% of actual THC content. Between plants of one cultivar, average Total THC varied by 2.8% which was statistically significant (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). Effect size (ES) measures were also reported for plant strata and plant against plant analysis. A comprehensive analysis of the extent of Total THC variation in samples of dried cannabis, evident both within and across plants of the same batch, has been presented using a random sampling and sample size calculated approach.

      "abstract": "Cannabis use represents a significant risk factor for both psychotic disorders and suicidal behaviors, with growing evidence suggesting complex interactions between these variables. This systematic review examines the relationship between cannabis use and suicide risk in first-episode psychosis (FEP) patients, and explores underlying mechanisms, moderating factors, and intervention strategies. Following PRISMA guidelines, we analyzed 50 studies involving 12,764 FEP patients. Results demonstrate that cannabis use, especially high-potency cannabis used regularly, is associated with significantly increased suicide risk with studies consistently reporting elevated odds ratios (ranging from 1.43 to 1.84), and dose-dependent effects-daily use showing higher risk (studies reporting OR: 2.73, 95\u202f% CI: 1.89-3.94) and high-THC cannabis carrying greatest risk (OR: 3.12, 95\u202f% CI: 2.11-4.62). Multiple mechanisms mediate this relationship: neurobiological alterations in the endocannabinoid system, exacerbation of depressive symptoms, impaired cognitive functions, increased duration of untreated psychosis, and reduced treatment adherence. Key vulnerability factors include early-onset cannabis use (before age 15-16), female gender, history of childhood trauma, and comorbid psychiatric disorders. Critical high-risk periods were identified, particularly the first month after treatment initiation and following hospital discharge. Effective intervention strategies include integrated early intervention programs combining pharmacological treatment with psychosocial approaches, specifically cognitive-behavioral therapy, motivational interviewing, and family interventions. Emerging evidence suggests potential therapeutic benefits of CBD and specific risk management protocols. This review highlights the clinical importance of assessing cannabis use patterns in FEP patients and implementing targeted interventions during critical periods, particularly given the increasing availability of high-potency cannabis products globally.",

      "abstract": "Cannabis (Cannabis sativa L.) has served as a valuable medicinal plant for thousands of years and is experiencing a resurgence in cultivation and research due to recent legal changes. However, the resource-intensive nature of cannabis cultivation, particularly water and energy demands, poses significant environmental challenges. Outdoor cultivation in a semi-controlled environment can reduce those energy demands but necessitates irrigation. Drip irrigation (DI) is the most commonly used irrigation method but is often criticized for its susceptibility to water losses through evaporation and the risk of surface runoff. Subsurface Drip Irrigation (SDI) provides a sustainable solution by minimizing evaporation losses while maintaining or increasing yields, thereby enhancing water use efficiency. In this study, we compared the effects of DI and SDI on weed infestation, total water usage, inflorescence yield, and water use efficiency of three CBD-rich cannabis chemotype III genotypes (Kanada, Terra Italia, FED) in an outdoor foil tunnel cultivation system. SDI resulted in a reduction of irrigation water usage by 18.6% compared to DI. Remarkably, weed dry biomass was reduced by 93.2% in SDI. Concomitantly, inflorescence yield increased by 5% and CBD concentration by 9%. Overall, the water use efficiency of inflorescence yield and CBD concentration was significantly higher in SDI than in DI. Our results indicated that implementing SDI instead of DI can significantly decrease irrigation water use and reduce weed infestation while increasing inflorescence and CBD yield, thus reducing the environmental challenges associated with cannabis cultivation.",

      "abstract": "Alcohol use disorder (AUD) remains a pervasive public health issue with limited effective treatments. Cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychotropic constituent of cannabis, shows promise in modulating addictive behaviors. This study investigated the effects of chronic CBD administration on alcohol dependence, withdrawal symptoms, and neurodegeneration using two complementary rodent models: chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) exposure, which models established alcohol dependence, and ethanol vapor self-administration (EVSA), which captures the volitional aspects of alcohol intake. In the CIE model, CBD reduced alcohol self-administration during acute withdrawal without affecting alcohol metabolism or locomotor activity. CBD decreased motivation for alcohol, somatic withdrawal signs, withdrawal-induced anxiety-like behaviors, and mechanical sensitivity. During extinction, CBD attenuated alcohol-seeking behavior and stress-induced reinstatement. Electrophysiological recordings revealed that CBD reversed alcohol-induced decreases in neuronal excitability in the basolateral amygdala, suggesting a mechanism involving normalization of neural function. In the EVSA model, CBD reduced voluntary alcohol intake during the escalation phase, impacting voluntary alcohol intake. This effect was specific to alcohol-related behaviors, as it did not affect saccharin self-administration. Immunohistochemical analyses showed that CBD prevented alcohol-induced neurodegeneration in the nucleus accumbens shell and dorsomedial striatum, regions implicated in the volitional control of alcohol consumption. These findings indicate that chronic CBD administration attenuates both behavioral and neurobiological facets of alcohol dependence by modulating neuronal excitability and preventing neurodegeneration, supporting its therapeutic potential for AUD and providing mechanistic insights for future research.",

In this study, participants ingested a cannabis-infused edible and provided breath samples before and at three timepoints after ingestion. Participants were assigned to one of two breath sampling devices. THC was found in most pre-use breath samples and THC concentration had variable trends after ingestion. Nineteen participants exhibited a maximum in their THC concentration at 47\u2009min, 92\u2009min, or 180\u2009min after ingestion, while six participants had their highest THC concentration before the observed ingestion and four participants had no significant change in THC concentration over the four samples. Five additional cannabinoids were detected in breath. While cannabidiol (CBD) trends followed THC trends for some participants, diverging trends in other participants suggest different biological processing of CBD derived from edibles. This proof-of-concept study shows that THC concentration in breath can increase after the ingestion of cannabis-infused edibles, but the uncertainty of breath measurements and a longer time window need to be further explored.",

      "abstract": "Cannabis use during pregnancy has recently become an important concern due to its increasing trend and association with neurodevelopmental alterations of exposed children. Although inhalation is the primary route of cannabis consumption in humans, few studies replicated this route in preclinical models of prenatal exposure. This study aimed to analyze the effects of chronic prenatal exposure to vaporized cannabis (PEVC) on hippocampal neurodevelopment, functionality, and learning and memory processes. Using a commercially available high-potency cannabis strain (THC 14.7%), pregnant rats were exposed to cannabis vapor from gestational day 8 to 21. A combination of primary hippocampal cultures, electrophysiological studies in slices, and behavioral tests was employed to assess the impact of PEVC. We found that PEVC induced presynaptic remodeling of hippocampal neurons in offspring under both basal and activity-dependent conditions by increasing synaptic vGlut1 abundance and the total recycling pool of synaptic vesicles. Chronic PEVC also induced a downregulation of CB1R at glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses. Additionally, an increase in axonal recruitment and synaptic efficacy was observed at hippocampal CA1 synapses of juvenile offspring. Moreover, long-lasting cognitive impairments were identified during adolescence, including deficits in spatial memory in male and female offspring. In summary, these findings demonstrate that exposure to high-potency cannabis vapor during pregnancy leads to significant changes in synaptic remodeling and efficacy, axonal recruitment, and long-term cognitive consequences in offspring.",

      "title": "Cannabidiol Induced Manic Episode: A Case Report.",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cannabidiol (CBD), a non-intoxicating compound derived from Cannabis sativa, has gained widespread popularity for its proposed therapeutic effects in conditions such as anxiety, insomnia, and chronic pain. Unlike tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), CBD is often perceived as safe, with minimal psychoactive properties. However, its psychiatric safety profile, particularly in relation to mood disorders, remains poorly understood. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 31-year-old male with no prior psychiatric history who developed a manic episode characterized by irritability, decreased need for sleep, hyperactivity, and aggression. These symptoms emerged after three months of escalating daily CBD use via vaping, reaching high doses shortly before admission. Toxicology screening was negative for other substances, and the patient showed clinical improvement with mood stabilizers and antipsychotics following the discontinuation of CBD. DISCUSSION: This case raises concerns about the potential of high-dose CBD to induce manic symptoms in certain individuals. While CBD has been proposed to have anxiolytic and antipsychotic effects, its influence on mood regulation may be complex and dose-dependent. The variability in commercial CBD product composition, including possible contamination or mislabeling, further complicates risk assessment. Current evidence from clinical trials on CBD's effects in mood disorders is limited and inconclusive. CONCLUSION: Clinicians should remain alert to the psychiatric effects of CBD, particularly in patients presenting with new-onset mood symptoms. This report underscores the need for controlled studies to assess the safety of CBD in psychiatric populations and calls for stricter regulation of cannabinoid products.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE OF STUDY: This retrospective review aimed to evaluate the prevalence of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-positive urine drug screens (UDS) in patients undergoing chronic opioid therapy (COT) for chronic pain at a single academic institution. With a growing national trend toward cannabis legalization and increased public access to marijuana for medical and recreational purposes, understanding the intersection between THC use and opioid prescribing practices is essential. The presence of THC on UDS has clinical, legal, and ethical implications, especially in regions where cannabis remains illegal. This study sought to quantify the prevalence of THC positivity in patients receiving COT for chronic pain. FINDINGS: A total of 244 UDS results were reviewed from January 1, 2024, to December 31, 2024. Among these, 24 patients (9.8%) tested positive for THC. Documentation and clinical responses to positive results varied, with some providers documenting patient counseling, while others did not acknowledge the result in the medical record. In a small subset of cases, positive THC findings contributed to changes in opioid therapy, including tapering or discontinuation. CONCLUSION: THC-positive UDS results are relatively common among patients receiving chronic opioid therapy, highlighting the increasing prevalence of cannabis use in this population. These findings align with prior literature and reinforce the need for individualized, non-punitive approaches to care. Routine screening, consistent documentation, and open communication about cannabis use are essential components of effective opioid risk stratification, safe prescribing practices, and informed treatment planning. These considerations are critical in regions where recreational marijuana remains illegal, which may further influence provider decision-making regarding ongoing opioid therapy.",

      "title": "Unravelling herbicide stress and its impact on metabolite profiling in Cannabis sativa: an investigative study.",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cannabis sativa L., renowned for its versatility in pharmaceutical, textile, and cosmetic industries, is highly susceptible to several agronomic and environmental factors, particularly herbicides. These chemical agents, while commonly used for weed control, can adversely affect plant growth, physiology, and secondary metabolite production. Understanding the plant's response to such external stressors is essential for optimizing its cultivation and ensuring the quality of its bioactive compounds. METHODS: In our current work, we studied the impact of two herbicides- glyphosate and metribuzin on the morpho-physiological and biochemical characteristics of cannabis plants. The secondary metabolite production analysis was carried out using Gas Chromatography-Mass S pectrometry (GC-MS). Furthermore, in silico studies using molecular modelling and optimization via Density Functional Theory (DFT) were performed, followed by molecular docking. RESULTS: It was observed that both herbicides greatly impact overall plant productivity including primary and secondary metabolite production. Further, glyphosate treatment caused an increase in fatty acid synthesis while the contrary was observed in case of metribuzin. Also, herbicide stress leads to the synthesis of cannabidivarol and cannabidiol although they were absent in the untreated group. These findings provide crucial insights for optimizing agricultural practices in cannabis cultivation. Moreover, molecular simulation results showed that both metribuzin and glyphosate bind at the active pocket of Tetrahydrocannabinolic acid synthase (THCA synthase) and offer a mechanistic explanation for the observed variations in \u03949 -tetrahydocannabinol (THC) levels by suggesting that both herbicides inhibit THCA synthase activity, contributing to a deeper understanding of herbicide-plant interactions at the molecular level. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that herbicide stress impacts overall cannabis productivity and alters biosynthesis. The stress notably stimulates the production of cannabidivarol and cannabidiol. In addition, molecular docking studies revealed that metribuzin binds to the same active channel as Cannabigerolic acid (CBGA)- the THC precursor, while glyphosate binds at the entrance, thereby hindering THC production. This multifaceted approach guides sustainable farming strategies and has implications for manipulating cannabinoid profiles in pharmaceutical and other industrial applications.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Medicinal cannabis has mixed evidence for treating anxiety and depression, yet patients frequently use it as a treatment. This observational study evaluated the effects of medicinal cannabis initiation in adults with clinically significant anxiety and/or depression over a 6-month period. METHODS: Adults with clinically significant anxiety and/or depression initiating medicinal cannabis use in Maryland, USA completed ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and longitudinal follow-up evaluations. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) assessments were completed at baseline and 1, 3, and 6\u00a0months after medicinal cannabis initiation. EMA measures were completed at baseline and daily for 8\u00a0weeks after cannabis initiation with measures collected before each cannabis use and at time of expected peak effect. Changes in anxiety and depression were evaluated using linear mixed effect models. RESULTS: Significant decreases from baseline in anxiety and depression were observed, with mean scores dropping below clinically significant levels within three months of initiation. EMA data indicated that most participants selected THC-dominant cannabis and acute reductions in anxiety, depression, and perceived driving ability along with increased ratings of feeling \"high\". Acute effects were dose-dependent: 10-15\u00a0mg of oral THC and at least 3 puffs of vaporized cannabis yielded the most robust reductions in anxiety and depression. CONCLUSIONS: Initiation of THC-dominant medicinal cannabis was associated with acute reductions in anxiety and depression, and sustained reductions in overall symptom severity over a 6-month period. Controlled clinical trials are needed to further investigate the efficacy and safety of medicinal cannabis for acute anxiety and depression symptom management.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The safety of oral cannabidiol (CBD) and cannabidiolic acid (CBDA)-rich hemp oil supplementation in dogs with cancer receiving chemotherapy has not been investigated. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the safety, tolerability, and influence on doxorubicin exposure over time of oral CBD/CBDA-rich hemp oil supplementation in dogs diagnosed with high grade lymphoma undergoing CHOP chemotherapy. ANIMALS: Client-owned dogs diagnosed with lymphoma. METHODS: Dogs were enrolled in this prospective, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial to receive either CBD/CBDA-rich hemp oil capsules or placebo during one cycle of CHOP chemotherapy. Primary outcomes evaluated included adverse events during chemotherapy, quality of life scores and doxorubicin area under the curve (AUC) over a 5-week period. RESULTS: Twenty-five dogs were enrolled, with 19 completing the trial. CBD/CBDA supplementation did not significantly affect doxorubicin AUC in the intervention group. The doxorubicin AUC was not different between groups at week 0 [placebo 390.8\u2009nM/h (318.6-479.4); CBD/CBDA 403.4\u2009nM/h (351.9-462.5)] but was different at week 5 [placebo 572.6 (448.3-731.2); CBD/CBDA 406.8 (3.23.2-551.8)]. CBD/CBDA supplementation was well-tolerated, and no serious adverse events were observed. No significant differences between groups were observed in hematological and biochemical variables. The mean (range) quality of life scores for placebo and CBD were 7.56 (0, 35), and 10.75 (0, 56), respectively, with no significant differences. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Short-term oral CBD/CBDA-rich hemp supplementation appeared safe and well-tolerated in dogs undergoing CHOP chemotherapy for lymphoma.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although only two drugs are FDA approved for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), clinical practice treatment includes off-label use of medications to address the troubling symptoms of ASD. Several trials showed the beneficial effects of medical cannabis for alleviating symptoms of ASD. However, data are lacking regarding its safety and effectiveness as a single agent compared to add-on therapy. AIMS: To compare the safety and effectiveness of medical cannabis as a monotherapy and add-on therapy in autistic children. METHODS: An open-label trial recruiting autistic children was performed and treated with medical cannabis oil with a THC:CBD ratio of 1:20, respectively. Tests were conducted at baseline and after 6\u2009months of therapy. A secondary analysis was done to compare physical and behavior parameters, using tests such as Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule and Wechsler tests in the two groups. RESULTS: Out of 109 participants, 81 completed the treatment. Thirty received cannabis as add-on therapy to a pre-existing treatment, whereas 51 received cannabis as monotherapy, with no observed differences in baseline characteristics between the groups. The mean maximal CBD dose was 3.1\u2009mg/kg/day in the monotherapy group, compared to 2.8\u2009mg/kg/day in the add-on group ( CONCLUSIONS: Add-on cannabis therapy is as safe as monotherapy treatment, without significant differences in efficacy.",

      "title": "Cannabis tolerance reduces symptom relief.",
      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: We measure for the first time how tolerance from repeated consumption of medical cannabis affects acute symptom management. METHODS: Using the Releaf App, medical cannabis patients recorded their symptoms, product type, cannabis consumption method, major cannabinoid levels, dosing patterns, and real-time symptom intensity levels prior to and following each cannabis administration session, as well as any side effects from usage. The sample consists of the first ten cannabis self-administration sessions recorded by 16,395 medical cannabis patients between 06/05/2016 and 09/19/22, yielding a sample of 120,691 symptom-specific treatment-level observations, recorded during 42,005 sessions. This study uses fixed effects least-squares regression analyses to analyze the effects of the session count on symptom relief. RESULTS: On average, people experienced a 0.5% decrease in symptom relief with each subsequent session (p < 0.001). Combustible products offered more therapeutic relief than vaping, eating or drinking; higher doses offered greater relief; and the reduction in symptom relief with subsequent usage was similar whether patients were treating pain, depression, or anxiety. Cannabis products' THC levels were positively associated with symptom relief; however, patients showed no changes in the THC levels of products with subsequent consumption. Patients increased the dose consumed as they completed more sessions. The results are robust to alternative treatment measures, including days since the first session was recorded. Subsample regressions indicate that experienced users drive most of the effects. Analyses assessing side effects show that factors, such as THC and dose, that increased symptom relief also increased side effects experienced. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: The findings suggest the majority of patients experience decreased symptom relief after repeated use of medical cannabis, counterbalanced by improvements in negative side effects. Of direct clinical relevance, THC levels and the dose can be adjusted to customize medical cannabis patient treatment, increase medication compliance, and improve treatment outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Cannabis products used for pain typically contain \u0394-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (\u03949-THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) in varied amounts, but data on the effects of specific cannabinoid formulations on different pain types are lacking. This study used the carrageenan-induced inflammatory pain model to test oral \u03949-THC, CBD, or their combination on acute edema and pain hypersensitivity. Male and female Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 10-14 per sex/group) were pretreated (1 hour) with vehicle (sesame oil), \u03949-THC (1, 3, and 10 mg/kg, p.o.), CBD (10, 30, 100 mg/kg, p.o.), or select doses of \u03949-THC + CBD combinations prior to an intraplantar \u03bb-carrageenan injection into the hind paw. The nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ketoprofen (10 and 20 mg/kg i.p.) or its vehicle (1:1:18 ethanol:Cremophor EL:saline [Millipor Sigma]) was administered to a separate group as a positive control. Measurements were conducted at baseline and 1, 3, and 5 hours after carrageenan injection. Carrageenan produced edema and hypersensitivity to radiant heat (hyperalgesia) and mechanical pressure (allodynia). \u03949-THC alone sex- and dose-dependently decreased hyperalgesia and allodynia but not inflammation, with effects of \u03949-THC being greater in females than males, and the lowest \u03949-THC dose was proinflammatory in males. CBD alone did not affect pain sensitivity but had modest anti-inflammatory effects in males. Isobolographic and dose addition analyses indicated \u03949-THC + CBD was subadditive relative to \u03949-THC alone. These data demonstrate that prophylactic oral \u03949-THC alleviates acute inflammatory pain with sex-dependent effects, and CBD diminishes \u03949-THC antinociception when combined. The findings suggest oral \u03949-THC is superior to CBD or combined \u03949-THC + CBD for acute inflammatory pain. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Despite the popularity of cannabis for pain management, empirical data on how specific cannabinoid formulations affect acute inflammatory pain are limited. This study in rats found that pure \u0394-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (\u03949-THC) formulations were most effective at improving inflammatory pain compared to pure cannabidiol or \u03949-THC + cannabidiol combinations, and females were more sensitive than males to the antinociceptive effects of \u03949-THC.",

      "abstract": "Inhibition of melanogenesis is of major interest in the cosmetic industry. The mechanism underlying melanogenesis includes regulating tyrosinase by activating various signaling pathways, such as protein kinase A and C pathways. Natural material-based agents have recently gained attention as alternative medicines to suppress melanogenic pathways. Cannabis sativa contains many bioactive compounds that are widely used in traditional herbal medicines. The aim of this study was to identify and assess the anti-melanogenic effect of terpene extract from Cannabis sativa flower (TCF) to explore novel depigmenting agents. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed that TCF contains five monoterpenes, eleven sesquiterpenes, and a diterpene. MTT and melanin content assays demonstrated that TCF significantly decreased the melanin content per live cell in a dose-dependent manner. Tyrosinase inhibition assay showed that TCF exhibited little inhibitory effect on tyrosinase at an equal dose, which reduced the melanin content. However, western blot analysis revealed that TCF downregulated microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), and tyrosinase-related proteins TRP1, and TRP2 expression by suppressing PKC, p38, and ERK/STAT3, while upregulated Akt pathway in melan-a. These results highlight the potential application of TCF as a natural whitening agent in the cosmetics industry.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common liver disorder caused by oxidative stress and dysregulation of lipid metabolism. The endocannabinoid system (ECS), particularly the type 1 cannabinoid (CB1) receptor, plays a crucial role in NAFLD progression. Cannabinoids, such as cannabidiol (CBD) and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), along with terpenes, such as beta-myrcene and d-limonene, have shown potential therapeutic effects on liver health, particularly in reducing oxidative stress and modulating lipid metabolism. This study aimed to analyse the effects of five cannabis oils (COs), each with different CBD:THC ratios and terpenes content, on hypertension, dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis, oxidative stress, and CB1 receptor expression in an experimental model of NAFLD induced by a sucrose-rich diet (SRD) in Wistar rats for 3 weeks. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were fed either a: (1) reference diet (RD; standard commercial laboratory diet) or a: (2) sucrose-rich diet (SRD) for 3 weeks. 3 to 7 SRD\u2009+\u2009CO as following: (3) SRD\u2009+\u2009THC; (4) SRD\u2009+\u2009CBD; (5) SRD\u2009+\u2009CBD:THC 1:1; (6) SRD\u2009+\u2009CBD:THC 2:1; and (7) SRD\u2009+\u2009CBD:THC 3:1. The COs were administered orally at a dose of 1.5\u00a0mg total cannabinoids/kg body weight daily. The cannabinoid and terpenes content of all COs used in the study was determined. The terpenes found in COs were beta-myrcene, d-limonene, terpinolene, linalool, beta-caryophyllene, alpha-humulene, (-)-guaiol, (-)-alpha-bisabolol. During the experimental period, body weight, food intake and blood pressure were measured. Serum glucose, triglyceride, total cholesterol, uric acid, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (AP) levels were evaluated. Liver tissue histology, NAFLD activity score (NAS), triglyceride and cholesterol content, lipogenic enzyme activities, enzyme related to mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, reactive oxygen species (ROS), thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS), and antioxidant enzyme activities were also evaluated. The CB1 receptor expression was also determined. RESULTS: The results showed that SRD-fed rats developed hypertension, dyslipidemia, liver damage, hepatic steatosis, lipid peroxidation, and oxidative stress. This was accompanied by upregulation of liver CB1 receptor expression. CBD-rich CO, CBD:THC 1:1 ratio CO; CBD:THC 2:1 ratio CO and CBD:THC 3:1 ratio CO showed antihypertensive properties. THC-rich CO, CBD:THC 1:1 ratio CO; CBD:THC 2:1 ratio CO showed the greatest beneficial effects against hepatic steatosis and liver damage. All COs exhibited antioxidant effects in liver tissue. This was associated with normal liver CB1 receptor expression. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that COs, particularly THC-rich CO, CBD:THC ratio 1:1 CO, CBD:THC ratio 2:1 CO and terpenes, can effectively reduce dyslipidemia, liver damage and hepatic steatosis in SRD-induced NAFLD. COs with a higher proportion of CBD in their composition showed antihypertensive properties. All the COs exhibited antioxidant properties. These findings suggest that COs, especially those with CBD:THC ratios of 1:1 and 2:1 and terpenes, may represent a promising therapeutic approach for managing NAFLD and preventing its progression to more severe liver disease.",

      "abstract": "Terpenes are the largest and most diverse class of natural products, essential for plant defence, ecological interactions, and environmental adaptation. Cannabis sativa is noted for its rich terpene profile, influencing aroma, flavour, and pharmacological properties. Limonene, a significant monoterpene, is commercially important in the fragrance and flavouring industries, making it a target for metabolic engineering. Terpene biosynthesis involves terpene synthase enzymes that convert isoprenoid diphosphates into diverse terpene scaffolds. Despite advances in terpene biochemistry, C. sativa TPSs lack structural characterisation. This study presents the first crystal structure of (-)-limonene synthase from C. sativa, offering insights into monoterpene biosynthesis. Solved at 3.2\u00a0\u00c5 resolution, the structure shows an \"open\" conformation with a solvent-accessible active site and disordered loops near the catalytic pocket, indicating a pre-catalytic state that aids substrate access. Biochemical characterisation confirmed limonene synthase as a highly specific monoterpene synthase, predominantly producing (-)-limonene from geranyl diphosphate with minor amounts of eight other monoterpenes.

      "abstract": "Cannabis sativa L. constituents, such as cannabinoids, terpenes, flavonoids, and other secondary metabolites, determine the plant's (medicinal) effects and properties in a complex interplay, a phenomenon known as the entourage effect. However, environmental influences like cultivation method, soil, light, and climate might also influence the plant's chemical composition-and thus its therapeutic profile. Much like in viticulture, the concept of a \"cannabis terroir\" might play an important role in determining the plant's chemical phenotype. The aim of this study was therefore to make these complex properties analytically accessible and develop a comprehensive metabolomics workflow using gas chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (GC-HRMS) and liquid chromatography-high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS/MS) in positive and negative ionization mode, applying HILIC and reversed phase chromatography to assess multiple chemical classes. Data processing and statistical analysis were done in MS-DIAL and MetaboAnalyst, respectively. The method was applied to 35 CBD-type cannabis flowers grown under different environmental conditions, and compounds belonging to various chemical classes were successfully detected. Principal component analysis revealed distinct clustering of the samples, and key discriminative features were identified, including cannabinoids, terpenes such as \u03b2-caryophyllene and \u03b1-humulene, cuticular alkanes (e.g., pentacosane and nonacosane), and polar compounds such as choline and trigonelline. The markers enabled a discrimination of samples not only by chemical phenotype but also by cultivation environment, supporting the emerging concept of a cannabis terroir. In conclusion, this study introduces an analytical framework for the comprehensive chemical profiling of cannabis employing GC-HRMS and LC-HRMS analysis and advanced statistical techniques.",

METHODS: Eleven female participants (5-16\u2009years) with a pathogenic variant in the MECP2 gene were recruited to this study, receiving NTI164 twice daily for 12\u2009weeks. The primary outcome measure was the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) Scale, with secondary outcomes measured using the CGI-Severity (CGI-S), RTT Behaviour Questionnaire (RSBQ), RTT-Symptom Index Score (RTT-SIS), RTT-Domain-Specific Concerns-Visual-Analog Scale (RTT-DSC-VAS), Impact of Childhood Neurological Disability/Quality of Life (ICND+QoL), and RTT-Caregiver Burden Inventory (RTT-CBI). Paired-samples t-test was used to assess significance between baseline and Week 12. RESULTS: Improvements were seen in the total CGI-I score (p\u2009=\u20090.028), with improvements in communication skills (p\u2009=\u20090.003), mental alertness (p\u2009=\u20090.033), socialisation/eye contact (p\u2009=\u20090.0004), attentiveness (p\u2009=\u20090.001), and anxiety (p\u2009=\u20090.004). CGI-S also demonstrated better outcomes after NTI164 administration (p\u2009=\u20090.008). RSBQ showed improvements in total score (p\u2009=\u20090.0005), general mood (p\u2009=\u20090.0003), breathing problems (p\u2009=\u20090.041), repetitive face movements (p\u2009=\u20090.004), and fear/anxiety (p\u2009=\u20090.006). RTT-DSC-VAS showed positive developments in abilities to communicate choices (p\u2009=\u20090.041). ICND total score was improved (p\u2009=\u20090.003), as well as cognition (p\u2009=\u20090.027) and Quality of Life (p\u2009=\u20090.0002). Total score on the RTT-CBI was improved (p\u2009=\u20090.006). CONCLUSION: NTI164 demonstrated safety and improved some clinical and functional outcomes in RTT. These improvements justify ongoing research into NTI164, which may be a potential adjunct therapy in RTT.",

      "abstract": "Cannabis sativa is a high-value plant renowned for its diverse chemical composition and abundant terpene content, contributing to its unique aroma, flavour, and therapeutic effects. Terpenes significantly influence consumer preference for C. sativa products, driving scientific interest in optimising terpene expression profiles and shaping the selective breeding of terpene profiles in C. sativa cultivars. In particular, the monoterpene, terpinolene, is influential in defining the sensory and therapeutic qualities of many C. sativa strains due to its woody, citrus-like aroma. Here we report the 2.5 \u00c5 resolution crystal structure of terpinolene synthase (CsTOS) from C. sativa in its apo form. The structure exhibits the class I monoterpene synthase fold with an open active site conformation. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we identified H618 as a key residues in determining product specificity. Substituting H618 with charged residues resulted in the preferential formation of limonene over terpinolene, highlighting its critical role in stabilising the substrate intermediate. Additionally, novel mutations uncovered an extended epistatic network of residues within 5 \u00c5 of the active site, spanning the \u03b1-helical bundle of the terpene synthase fold. These interactions contribute to monoterpene formation by modulating substrate positioning and catalytic activity. These insights advance our understanding of monoterpene biosynthesis and enable the targeted engineering of terpene synthases for customised terpene production, offering significant potential for the C. sativa industry.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This review article addresses the vaping chemistry of manufactured cannabis concentrates-a topic that remains under-researched despite the widespread availability and growing popularity of these products. Given their current prevalence and the fact that many of the findings discussed herein are from early-stage investigations, further research is essential to fully assess the public health risks associated with concentrate use. The purpose of this article is to help begin to bridge this knowledge gap by outlining the technical challenges of studying cannabis concentrates and to present evidence-based data concerning toxicant exposures as a foundation for future investigations. METHODS: A search of cannabis concentrate vaping within the date range of 2019-2025 on Google Scholar returned approximately 2,700 hits. A cannabis concentrate was defined as a sample containing at least 50% (w/w) cannabinoids. In addition to our group's articles, the search results contained six manuscripts that described at least a partial focus on molecular emissions specifically derived from vaping or dabbing samples that included cannabis concentrates. FINDINGS: Studying cannabis concentrate vaping poses distinct technical challenges that differ from those associated with electronic nicotine delivery systems. Emissions from vaping concentrates contain a substantial proportion of harmful aerosol toxicants, including isoprene, 3-methylcrotonaldehyde, 3-methyl-1-butene, and 2-methyl-2-butene. Moreover, some concentrate formulations have contained hazardous additives such as pine rosin and ketene precursors such as cannabinoid acetates. As with nicotine vaping, the presence of oxygen plays a critical role in driving the formation of many toxic chemical degradation products during vaping. CONCLUSION: Since the legalization of recreational cannabis, concentrates have become one of the most rapidly expanding segments of the U.S. cannabis market. However, research into the specific health risks of vaping these products has significantly lagged their widespread use. The studies presented in this review article highlight the potential for exposure to known toxicants during the vaping of cannabis concentrates.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Triterpenoid compounds such as betulinic acid (BA) and oleanolic acid (OA) exhibit considerable pharmacological activities. However, their current production primarily relies on plant extraction and chemical synthesis, methods that are often plagued by low efficiency, complex extraction processes, and environmental concerns. Microbial-based synthesis has emerged as one of the most effective approaches for producing BA and OA. RESULTS: This study presented the first identification of filamentous fungal strains efficiently synthesizing both BA and OA. The strain ZBS49 is a newly identified species of Clonostachys isolated from Gleditsia japonica Miq. (showing 99.82% sequence identity), produced 47.7\u00a0mg/L of BA. The strain XJ1-1, characterized as Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and isolated from Cannabis sativa L., yielded 65.76\u00a0mg/L of OA. After optimizing the culture medium and cultivation conditions, the yields of ZBS49 and XJ1-1 increased to 288.97 and 86.14\u00a0mg/L, representing improvements of 506% and 31%, respectively. Furthermore, we discovered that the BA extract of the ZBS49 strain significantly inhibited hepatocellular cancer cells (SMMC-7721 and HepG2) in a dose-dependent manner, with a minimum inhibitory concentration of 70 \u00b5M. Genomic analysis of Clonostachys sp. ZBS49 elucidated that the presence of 16 putative genes was related to triterpenoid biosynthesis and 6 distinct terpene biosynthetic gene clusters. Among the 145 CYP450, 5 genes involved in C-28 oxidation were predicted. CONCLUSIONS: This research underscores the effectiveness of filamentous fungi as a biotechnological platform for the efficient production of BA and its derivatives, highlighting their potential applications in cancer therapy. Furthermore, these findings provide valuable genetic resources and establish a robust technical and theoretical framework for utilizing ZBS49 as a microbial platform for the biosynthesis of triterpenoids.",

      "abstract": "Light supplementation within the canopy is an effective method to improve light distribution throughout the whole plant, ensuring the inner canopies receive adequate light exposure to maximize overall growth. This approach is gaining interest among cannabis growers looking for more efficient lighting strategies to enhance their valuable production for medicinal purposes. We compared the traditional top lighting (TL) approach with two light supplementation methods: subcanopy lighting (SCL), which adds extra light to the inner canopies from below, and inter-canopy lighting (ICL), providing dedicated light at the basal and middle levels. Both SCL and ICL resulted in a more uniform light distribution throughout the plants and increased the yields of inflorescences, cannabinoids, and terpenes. The ICL treatment achieved the highest yield increases, showing a 29.95% increase in dry inflorescence yield, a 24.4% higher accumulation of THC, and a 12.5% increase in total terpene concentration. Notably, both SCL and ICL reduced the coefficients of variation, yielding more standardized products by decreasing the variability of the dry inflorescences yield, which also had more consistent chemical profiles, with reductions in variability for both THC and total terpene yields of over 50%. Although using more energy for lighting, SCL was more power-efficient for inflorescence and cannabinoid yields, while ICL was more efficient in achieving yield enhancements. In conclusion, adding supplemental light to the inner canopies enhances the profitability of medical cannabis cultivation, resulting in higher yields, improved energy efficiency, and more standardized products for research and medical purposes.",

      "abstract": "Epilepsy is a widespread neurological disorder that remains a critical global public health challenge. While numerous antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are available, many patients either fail to achieve adequate seizure control or experience significant side effects. One promising alternative is pure cannabidiol (CBD), but using a whole cannabis extract may be equally effective and preferred for some patients. In the current study, we employed the pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced hyperactivity model in zebrafish to compare the effects of CBD with various cannabis extracts. We evaluated three cannabis strains, each subjected to three different extraction methods, and benchmarked the results against the commercially available AED valproic acid (VPA). Our findings revealed that 5.7 \u00b5g/mL of CBD and 10 \u00b5g/mL of different extracts significantly reduced movement compared to PTZ and VPA. In addition, effective extracts produced effects similar to pure CBD despite containing much lower molecule levels. These results reinforced and expanded previous evidence supporting the clinical potential of both CBD and whole cannabis extracts for seizure control while suggesting a possible entourage effect. Further research is necessary to determine which patients may benefit more from pure CBD versus those who might prefer whole cannabis extracts.",

      "abstract": "Cannabis sativa is a medicinally and economically significant plant known for its production of cannabinoids, terpenoids, and other secondary metabolites. This study presents a transcriptomic analysis to elucidate tissue-specific expression and regulatory mechanisms across leaves, stems, and roots. A total of 2,530 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, with key genes such as terpene synthase (TPS) and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) exhibiting elevated expression in leaf tissues, emphasizing their roles in terpenoid and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. Alternative splicing (AS) analysis revealed 8,729 distinct events, dominated by exon skipping, contributing to transcriptomic diversity. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) prediction identified 3,245 candidates, many of which displayed tissue-specific expression patterns and co-expression with metabolic genes, suggesting regulatory roles in secondary metabolism. Additionally, 12,314 SNPs and 2,786 INDELs were detected, with notable enrichment in genes associated with secondary metabolite biosynthesis, particularly in leaf tissues. These findings advance the understanding of molecular mechanisms governing secondary metabolism and genetic diversity in C. sativa, providing valuable insights for future metabolic engineering and breeding strategies to enhance cannabinoid production.",

      "abstract": "Cannabinoids and terpenes, key bioactive components of cannabis, are increasingly studied for their individual and combined contributions to the therapeutic potential of cannabis-based treatments, with ongoing research exploring their distinct and interactive effects. This study aimed to encapsulate cannabigerolic acid (CBGA) in poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles (PEG-PLGA NPs) and investigate the effects of combining CBGA NPs with cannabis-derived terpene-loaded NPs (myrcene [MC], nerolidol [NL], and caryophyllene [CPh]) for potential applications in pain management. CBGA NPs (152\u00a0nm) and terpene-loaded NPs (233-297\u00a0nm) were prepared via nanoprecipitation and emulsion-solvent evaporation, respectively, exhibiting a polydispersity index\u00a0<\u00a00.3 and negative zeta potentials (-23 to -26\u00a0mV). Encapsulation efficiency was 98.6\u00a0% for CBGA and 13-33\u00a0% for terpenes. CBGA release followed a biphasic profile, with\u00a0\u223c\u00a020\u00a0% released within 4\u00a0h and sustained release over 72\u00a0h. In vitro evaluation used HEK293 cells expressing the nociceptive transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1) channel, a key mediator of pain perception. TRPV1 activation was assessed via calcium influx kinetics (Fluo-4 indicator). The EC50 values were 23.8\u00a0\u00b5g/mL (CBGA NPs), 8.0\u00a0\u00b5g/mL (MC NPs), 6.7\u00a0\u00b5g/mL (NL NPs), and 13.3\u00a0\u00b5g/mL (CPh NPs). Combinatorial treatments of CBGA NPs with terpene NPs at their respective EC50 concentrations revealed significantly enhanced calcium influx compared to individual NPs, with the strongest interaction observed for CBGA/NL and moderate effects for CBGA/MC. Fluorescence imaging further corroborated these findings. These results suggest that combining CBGA NPs with terpene-loaded NPs could potentiate pain-relief efficacy, offering a promising strategy for advanced therapeutic formulations.",

The effects of solvent type, temperature, time, and pressure were evaluated using five organic solvents and two binary solvent systems. Cannabinoid profiles of obtained extracts were analyzed using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS), while terpene profiles were characterized through solid-phase microextraction (SPME) combined with GC-MS. Next, two selected extracts with the highest content of cannabinoid and terpene fractions (Futu1 and Futu2) were tested for antiproliferative activity toward cancer cell lines (MV4-11, AGS, HT-29, MDA-MB-468, MCF-7) and their cytotoxicity was evaluated on non-tumorigenic MCF-10A cells. Extract Futu1 contained 51.57% cannabinoids, 9.8% monoterpenes, and 90.2% sesquiterpenes in the terpene fraction. Futu2 exhibited a higher proportion of monoterpenes in the terpene fraction (19.6% monoterpenes and 80.4% sesquiterpenes) and consisted of 49.49% cannabinoids. Both extracts exhibited higher selectivity for cancer cells over non-tumorigenic cells, with Futu2 demonstrating stronger antiproliferative properties. Interestingly, lower concentrations of extracts and tested free, single cannabinoids stimulated the growth of leukemia (MV4-11) and breast cancer (MDA-MB-468) cell lines while their higher concentrations suppressed proliferation.",

      "abstract": "The need for nonaddictive and effective treatments for chronic pain are at an all-time high. Historical precedence, and now clinical evidence, supports the use of cannabis for alleviating chronic pain. A plethora of research on delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol exists, yet cannabis is comprised of a multitude of constituents, some of which possess analgesic potential, that have not been systematically investigated, including the terpene myrcene. Myrcene attenuates pain hypersensitivity in preclinical models and is one of the most abundant terpenes found in cannabis. Despite these findings, it remains unclear how myrcene elicits these effects on nociceptive systems. The present study uses a male and female mouse model of neuropathic pain as well as in vitro experiments with HEK293T cells to explore these questions. We first demonstrate myrcene (1-200 mg/kg i.p.) dose-dependently increases mechanical nociceptive thresholds, where potency was greater in female compared with male pain mice. Testing canonical tetrad outcomes, mice were tested for hypolocomotion and hypothermia after myrcene administration. Myrcene did not alter locomotion or temperature, but female pain mice showed a conditioned place aversion to myrcene. A cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) antagonist inhibited myrcene's anti-allodynia. By contrast, in vitro cell culture experiments using a TRUPATH assay revealed myrcene does not directly activate CB1 receptors nor alter CB1 receptor activity elicited by CB1 agonist (CP 55,940) or endocannabinoids (anandamide or 2-arachidonoylglycerol). Understanding engagement of CB1 receptors in pain modulation and myrcene's mechanism of action warrants further study to understand the diversity of cannabis pharmacology and to further the frontier of pain research.",

      "title": "A Validated GC-MS Method for Major Terpenes Quantification in Hydrodistilled Cannabis sativa Essential oil.",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Terpenes, which are found in high concentrations in the essential oil fraction of the Cannabis sativa flower, have demonstrated potential in many therapeutic and industrial applications. OBJECTIVES: This work reports on a method developed for quantifying 18 terpenes in C. sativa essential oil obtained through hydrodistillation. The following method has been evaluated for specificity, selectivity, accuracy, linearity, precision, stability, limit of detection, and limit of quantification. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Samples were prepared by separating the essential oil fraction through hydrodistillation and then diluting with ethyl acetate containing a 100\u2009\u03bcg/mL solution of n-tridecane and octadecane as internal standards. Analysis was performed on a gas chromatograph mass spectrometer (GCMS) using selected ion monitoring (SIM). RESULTS: The developed method enabled quantification of isomers of nerolidol and ocimene and several coeluting compounds, with recoveries of 87.35%-116.61%. Two cultivars of C. sativa flower were evaluated, and the dominant terpene compounds in both cultivars were \u03b2-myrcene (5.85-8.62\u2009mg/g dried plant) and \u03b2-caryophyllene (3.89-4.69\u2009mg/g), followed by \u03b1-humulene (1.35-1.99\u2009mg/g), limonene (0.91-1.33\u2009mg/g), and \u03b1-bisabolol (0.66-0.68\u2009mg/g). CONCLUSION: This method provides an accurate and reliable procedure for separating and quantifying the major terpene compounds in C. sativa flower using hydrodistillation and GCMS with SIM. The simplicity and solvent-free nature of the hydrodistillation extraction, combined with the specificity and accuracy of using SIM and external standards, enables the determination of total and individual terpenes concentrations within plant material and supports numerous industrial and therapeutic applications.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Cannabis sativa has been widely used in traditional medicine for its therapeutic properties. However, in Morocco, the ethnobotanical applications of Cannabis sativa, especially its essential oils, are underexplored. This study investigates, for the first time, the effects of Moroccan Cannabis sativa essential oil on peripheral neuropathic pain. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Peripheral neuropathic pain was induced in mice through sciatic nerve injury. The mice were treated daily with cannabis essential oil for 21 days. Behavioral tests were conducted on days 1, 7, 14, and 21 to evaluate thermal, mechanical, and cold sensitivity. The essential oil's chemical composition was analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS). RESULTS: The main constituents of the essential oil were (E)-caryophyllene (41.59%) and \u03b1-humulene (14%). Daily treatment with the essential oil significantly reduced pain sensitivity and improved functional and histological recovery over time. These effects are linked to the activity of the dominant terpenoids in the oil. CONCLUSION: Moroccan Cannabis sativa essential oil shows significant therapeutic potential for managing peripheral neuropathic pain. By enhancing recovery and alleviating pain symptoms, it offers a promising alternative for treating chronic pain caused by nerve injuries.",

      "title": "Entourage effects of nonpsychotropic cannabinoids on visceral sensitivity in experimental colitis.",
      "abstract": "Abdominal pain is the most disabling symptom of inflammatory bowel diseases, but current treatments are limited, leading patients to seek alternatives such as cannabis. Cannabis contains over 100 cannabinoids which, unlike tetrahydrocannabinol, are biologically active compounds often without psychotropic effects (ie, nonpsychotropic cannabinoids [npCBs]). These npCBs have analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties and may show potentiating effects when administered in combination, referred to as the entourage effect. Here, we investigated the analgesic effects of cannabichromene, cannabidiol (CBD), cannabidivarin, and cannabigerol (CBG), individually and in combination, using the mouse model of dextran sulfate sodium colitis-induced visceral hypersensitivity (VHS). We then explored antinociceptive targets through patch-clamp electrophysiology on dorsal root ganglia neurons and recombinant channels. We found that a single injection of 10 mg/kg of either CBD or CBG reduced both VHS and c-Fos activation in the spinal dorsal horn. Moreover, a combination of npCBs consisting of 5 mg/kg CBD with 1 mg/kg of cannabichromene, cannabidivarin, and CBG-all at subtherapeutic dosages-reduced VHS, without altering colitis. Electrophysiological recordings revealed that the antinociceptive mixture of npCBs acts through voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels, particularly Cav2.2, but not Cav3.2 and Kv channels. These results suggest that CBD, CBG, and a mixture of npCBs given at subtherapeutic doses may be beneficial in managing VHS associated with inflammatory bowel disease. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Cannabis is increasingly used as an alternative treatment for managing pain associated with chronic conditions. Nonpsychotropic cannabinoids, such as cannabidiol, interact with ionotropic and voltage-gated ion channels. In our study, we demonstrated that cannabidiol, cannabigerol, and a combination of nonpsychotropic cannabinoids, administered at subtherapeutic doses, effectively alleviated visceral hypersensitivity associated with inflammatory bowel disease.",

      "abstract": "Cannabis sativa L. is an important medicinal plant with high commercial value. In recent years, the research interest in cannabidiol (CBD) and terpene-rich cannabis has been rapidly expanding due to their high therapeutic potential. The present study aims to explore the phytocannabinoids and terpenes diversity in C. sativa collected from different parts of northern India. Our findings revealed that the cannabinoids and terpenes synthesize together in capitate stalked and capitate sessile glandular trichomes, whereas bulbous glands synthesize only terpenes. The North Indian C. sativa is mainly dominated by tetrahydrocannabinol. The CBD-rich plant diversity is nominal (1.11%) in studied north Indian C. sativa. The essential oil profiling reveals (E)-caryophyllene (10.30%-36.80%) as the major constituent, followed by \u03b1-humulene (0.50%-15.29%) and \u03b1-bisabolol (0.00%-16.40%) in the North Indian population. The cannabinoids and terpenes content showed significant diversity among and within the five studied populations. The correlation analysis between cannabinoids and terpenes indicates that \u03b1-pinene, \u03b2-pinene and limonene positively correlated with CBD content. Similarly, \u03b1- and \u03b2-selinene correlate positively with tetrahydrocannabinolic acid content. This study could help to identify the key cultivars from India and establish a consistent chemotype for future breeding programs.",

However, the contribution of these terpenes in anxiety, at relevant levels and exposure methods common with cannabis use, is lacking empirical assessment. We tested the anxiolytic properties of two prominent cannabis terpenes, linalool and \u03b2-myrcene, in male and female mice using short duration vapor pulls to model human inhalation when combusting flower or vaping cannabis oil. We observed sex differences in the locomotor effects in the open field and anxiolytic properties in the elevated plus maze of these terpenes that depended on their exposure characteristics. Both linalool and \u03b2-myrcene had anxiolytic effects in female mice when delivered in discrete vapor pulls over the course of 30 min. In male mice, only a single vapor hit containing linalool or \u03b2-myrcene had anxiolytic effects. The combination of sub-effective levels of linalool and the phytocannabinoid, cannabidiol (CBD), had synergistic anxiolytic effects in females, but these entourage effects between CBD and terpenes were absent with \u03b2-myrcene for females and for either terpene in males. Together, our findings reveal sex differences in the anxiolytic properties of common cannabis terpenes and highlight the potential benefits of unique combinations of CBD and terpenes in expanding the therapeutic dose window.",

      "abstract": "Cannabis flower scent is one of the key characteristics of the cannabis plant. The diverse scents impact user experiences and offer medicinal benefits. These scents originate from volatile compounds, particularly terpenes and terpenoids. This study characterized the volatile profile of 19 different dried cannabis flowers using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry coupled with headspace-solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME-GC-MS). A total of 75 compounds were identified, including alcohols, aldehydes, benzenes, esters, ketone, monoterpenes, monoterpenoids, sesquiterpenes, and sesquiterpenoids. Cluster analysis was able to group the 19 cannabis cultivars into five clusters based on volatile chemotypes using chemometric techniques of hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and principal component analysis (PCA). Potential discriminant markers of each cultivar were then analyzed using a supervised partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) verified through Variable Importance in Projection values (VIP), identifying twenty discriminant markers. In addition, the correlations among 75 volatile compounds were also obtained. The findings of this study provide a valuable database of single cannabis cultivars, useful for identifying individual strains and verifying their quality. Clustering the cultivars by volatile chemotype can be used for the classification of cannabis in the market. The results of this study are expected to be a starting point for further cannabis breeding programs to expand knowledge of this plant. Furthermore, the proposed method is applicable to other aroma plants in the future.",

      "abstract": "Terpenes, volatile compounds known for their aromatic and therapeutic properties, play a pivotal role in shaping the overall chemical profile of Cannabis sativa L. Their biosynthesis in planta occurs in trichomes and involves the 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) and the mevalonic acid (MVA) pathways, responsible for producing the substrates utilized by a family of enzymes, the terpene synthases (TPS), for terpene production. In this work, a comprehensive approach combining chemical analyses of the volatile compounds characterizing the aroma of the inflorescences three C. sativa genotypes collected at three stages of maturity and the transcriptional analyses of key genes involved in the terpene biosynthesis was adopted to study this pathway. The results revealed different terpene profiles among genotypes, which were characterized by peculiar compounds belonging to the sesqui- (CINBOL and Fibrante) or monoterpene (Ermo) categories. Both structural and putative regulatory genes were analysed by RT-qPCR, revealing distinct transcriptional profiles of Terpene Synthases, contributing to the diversity of mono and sesquiterpenes synthesized. Furthermore, the research delved into potential regulatory genes associated with trichome formation, a crucial factor influencing terpene accumulation. This integrated approach highlighted complex mechanisms governing terpene accumulation in cannabis, while also offering potential regulators putatively involved in this pathway.",

      "abstract": "Cannabis terpenes and terpenoids are among the major classes of pharmacologically active secondary metabolites of therapeutic interest. Indeed, these hydrocarbon molecules, responsible for the characteristic aroma of cannabis flowers, are thought to be involved in a synergistic effect known as the \"entourage effect\", together with cannabinoids. Numerous analytical studies have been carried out to characterize the terpene and terpenoid contents of some cannabis varieties, but they have not proposed any real quantification or have described a limited number of analytical standards or average response factors, which may have led to over- or underestimation of the real content of the cannabis flowers. Real and reliable quantification is necessary to justify the entourage effect. Here, we report a rigorous and precise GC-FID and GC-MS method for the identification and quantification of cannabis terpenes and terpenoids. This method is distinguished by the use of a high number of analytical standards, the determination of retention indices for all compounds studied, an exhaustive comparison of databases and scientific literature, the use of relevant response factors, and internal calibration for reliable results. It was applied to the study of terpenic compounds in five commercial varieties of medicinal cannabis produced by Bedrocan International: a CBD-rich (Bedrolite\u00ae), a THC/CBD balanced (Bediol\u00ae), and three THC-dominant (Bedrocan\u00ae, Bedica\u00ae and Bedrobinol\u00ae). Two extraction solvents are described (ethanol and hexane) to compare their selectivity towards target molecules, and to describe as exhaustively as possible the terpenic profile of the five pharmaceutical-grade varieties. Twenty-three standards were used for accurate dosages. This work highlights that the choice of solvent and the analysis method reliability are critical for the study of these terpenic compounds, regarding their contribution to the entourage effect.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Cannabis sativa L. inflorescences are rich in cannabinoids and terpenes. Traditional chemical analysis methods for cannabinoids and terpenes, such as liquid and gas chromatography (using UV or MS detectors), are expensive and time-consuming. OBJECTIVES: This study explores the use of Fourier transform near-infrared (FT-NIR) spectroscopy combined with chemometric approaches for classifying cannabis chemovars and predicting cannabinoid and terpene concentrations for the first time in freshly harvested (wet) cannabis inflorescence. The study also compares the performance of FT-NIR spectroscopy on wet versus dry cannabis inflorescences. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Spectral data from 187 samples across seven cannabis chemovars were analyzed using partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and partial least squares-regression (PLS-R) models. RESULTS: The PLS-DA models effectively classified chemovars and major classes using only two latent variables (LVs) with minimal overfitting risk, with sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy values approaching 1. Despite the high water content in wet cannabis inflorescence, the PLS-R models demonstrated good to excellent predictive capabilities for nine cannabinoids and eight terpenes using FT-NIR spectra for the first time, achieving cross-validation and prediction R-squared values greater than 0.7, ratio of performance to interquartile range (RPIQ) exceeding 2, and a RMSECV/RMSEC ratio below 1.24. However, the low-cannabidiolic acid submodel and (-)-\u03949-trans-tetrahydrocannabinol model showed poor predictive performance. Some cannabinoid and terpene prediction models in wet cannabis inflorescence exhibited lower predictive capabilities compared with previously published models for dry cannabis inflorescence. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that FT-NIR spectroscopy can be a viable rapid on-site analytical tool for growers during the inflorescence flowering stage.",

      "abstract": "AIMS: Phytocannabinoids and terpenes from Cannabis sativa have demonstrated limited anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects in several inflammatory conditions. In the current study, we test the hypothesis that phytocannabinoids exert immunomodulatory effects in vitro by decreasing inflammatory cytokine expression and activation. KEY METHODS: CD3/CD28 and lipopolysaccharide activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors (n\u00a0=\u00a06) were treated with phytocannabinoid compounds and terpenes in vitro. Flow cytometry was used to determine regulatory T cell (Treg) and T helper 17 (Th17) cell responses to treatments. Cell pellets were harvested for qRT-PCR gene expression analysis of cytokines, cell activation markers, and inflammation-related receptors. Cell culture supernatants were analysed by ELISA to quantify IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-10 secretion. MAIN FINDINGS: In an initial screen of 20\u00a0\u03bcM cannabinoids and terpenes which were coded to blind investigators, cannabigerol (GL4a), caryophyllene oxide (GL5a) and gamma-terpinene (GL6a) significantly reduced cytotoxicity and gene expression levels of IL6, IL10, TNF, TRPV1, CNR1, HTR1A, FOXP3, RORC and NFK\u03921. Tetrahydrocannabinol (GL7a) suppression of T cell activation was associated with downregulation of RORC and NFK\u03921 gene expression and reduced IL-6 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) and IL10 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) secretion. Cannabidiol (GL1b) significantly suppressed activation of Tregs (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and Th17 cells (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in a follow-on in vitro dose-response study. IL-6 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and IL-10 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) secretion was significantly reduced with 50\u00a0\u03bcM cannabidiol. SIGNIFICANCE: The study provides the first evidence that cannabidiol and tetrahydrocannabinol suppress extracellular expression of both anti- and pro-inflammatory cytokines in an in vitro PBMC model of inflammation.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Cannabis sativa L. is renowned for its medicinal and recreational uses. With the increasing global legalization of C.\u00a0sativa L.-based products for medicinal purposes, there is a growing need for well-characterized products. While the stability of cannabinoids such as tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol is well understood, information on the chemical and enantiomeric stability of terpenes remains scarce. This is despite the fact that terpenes are also thought to have pharmacological activity and may contribute to the overall effect of C.\u00a0sativa L. METHODS: To address these challenges, four analytical methods based on chiral, polar, and apolar gas chromatographic separation combined with either MS or FID detection were developed and validated. These methods successfully separated and quantified a total of 29 terpenes, including 13 enantiomers and 5 diastereomers specific to C.\u00a0sativa L. Furthermore, terpenes and authentic C.\u00a0sativa L. flowers and extracts were subjected to UV and heat treatments to observe potential degradation reactions over time. RESULTS: Each terpene generates a unique pattern of degradation products resulting in a diverse array of oxidation and cyclization products. P-cymene was identified as a major product of terpene aging. Notably, no enantiomeric conversion was detected, suggesting that the formation of (-)-\u03b1-pinene in cannabis extracts, for example, originates from other terpenes. CONCLUSION: Terpenes have different degradation rates, even though they are structurally similar. In addition, cultivar- and growth-condition-specific enantiomeric ratios were observed in C.\u00a0sativa L., confirming that enantiomer production is species-specific and has to be considered for therapeutical applications.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This review article addresses the vaping chemistry of manufactured cannabis concentrates-a topic that remains under-researched despite the widespread availability and growing popularity of these products. Given their current prevalence and the fact that many of the findings discussed herein are from early-stage investigations, further research is essential to fully assess the public health risks associated with concentrate use. The purpose of this article is to help begin to bridge this knowledge gap by outlining the technical challenges of studying cannabis concentrates and to present evidence-based data concerning toxicant exposures as a foundation for future investigations. METHODS: A search of cannabis concentrate vaping within the date range of 2019-2025 on Google Scholar returned approximately 2,700 hits. A cannabis concentrate was defined as a sample containing at least 50% (w/w) cannabinoids. In addition to our group's articles, the search results contained six manuscripts that described at least a partial focus on molecular emissions specifically derived from vaping or dabbing samples that included cannabis concentrates. FINDINGS: Studying cannabis concentrate vaping poses distinct technical challenges that differ from those associated with electronic nicotine delivery systems. Emissions from vaping concentrates contain a substantial proportion of harmful aerosol toxicants, including isoprene, 3-methylcrotonaldehyde, 3-methyl-1-butene, and 2-methyl-2-butene. Moreover, some concentrate formulations have contained hazardous additives such as pine rosin and ketene precursors such as cannabinoid acetates. As with nicotine vaping, the presence of oxygen plays a critical role in driving the formation of many toxic chemical degradation products during vaping. CONCLUSION: Since the legalization of recreational cannabis, concentrates have become one of the most rapidly expanding segments of the U.S. cannabis market. However, research into the specific health risks of vaping these products has significantly lagged their widespread use. The studies presented in this review article highlight the potential for exposure to known toxicants during the vaping of cannabis concentrates.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Terpenes, which are found in high concentrations in the essential oil fraction of the Cannabis sativa flower, have demonstrated potential in many therapeutic and industrial applications. OBJECTIVES: This work reports on a method developed for quantifying 18 terpenes in C. sativa essential oil obtained through hydrodistillation. The following method has been evaluated for specificity, selectivity, accuracy, linearity, precision, stability, limit of detection, and limit of quantification. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Samples were prepared by separating the essential oil fraction through hydrodistillation and then diluting with ethyl acetate containing a 100\u2009\u03bcg/mL solution of n-tridecane and octadecane as internal standards. Analysis was performed on a gas chromatograph mass spectrometer (GCMS) using selected ion monitoring (SIM). RESULTS: The developed method enabled quantification of isomers of nerolidol and ocimene and several coeluting compounds, with recoveries of 87.35%-116.61%. Two cultivars of C. sativa flower were evaluated, and the dominant terpene compounds in both cultivars were \u03b2-myrcene (5.85-8.62\u2009mg/g dried plant) and \u03b2-caryophyllene (3.89-4.69\u2009mg/g), followed by \u03b1-humulene (1.35-1.99\u2009mg/g), limonene (0.91-1.33\u2009mg/g), and \u03b1-bisabolol (0.66-0.68\u2009mg/g). CONCLUSION: This method provides an accurate and reliable procedure for separating and quantifying the major terpene compounds in C. sativa flower using hydrodistillation and GCMS with SIM. The simplicity and solvent-free nature of the hydrodistillation extraction, combined with the specificity and accuracy of using SIM and external standards, enables the determination of total and individual terpenes concentrations within plant material and supports numerous industrial and therapeutic applications.",

      "abstract": "Increased acceptance of cannabis containing the psychoactive component, \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), raises concerns about the potential for impaired drivers and increased highway accidents. In contrast to the \"breathalyzer\" test, which is generally accepted for determining the alcohol level in a driver, there is no currently accepted roadside test for THC in a motorist. There is a need for an easily collectible biological sample from a potentially impaired driver coupled with an accurate on-site test to measure the presence and quantity of THC in a driver. A novel breath collection device is described, which includes three separate sample collectors for collecting identical A, B, and C breath samples from a subject. A simple one-step ethanol extraction of the \"A\" breath collector sample can be analyzed by UHPLC/selected ion monitoring (SIM) liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) to provide qualitative and quantitative determination of THC in breath sample in less than 4\u2009min for samples collected up to 6\u2009h after smoking a cannabis cigarette. SIM LC/MS bioanalyses employed d3-THC as the stable isotope internal standard fortified in negative control breath samples for quantitation including replicates of six calibrator standards and three quality control (QC) samples. Subsequent confirmation of the same breath sample in the B collectors was then confirmed by a reference lab by LC/MS/MS analysis. Fit-for-purpose bioanalytical validation consistent with pharmaceutical regulated bioanalyses produced pharmacokinetic (PK) curves for the two volunteer cannabis smokers. These results produced PK curves, which showed a rapid increase of THC in the breath of the subjects in the first hour followed by reduced THC levels in the later time points. A simpler single-point calibration curve procedure with calibrators and QC prepared in ethanol provided similar results. Limitations to this approach include the higher cost and operator skill sets for the instrumentation employed and the inability to actually determine driver impairment.",

      "title": "In Silico Assessment of Cannabidiol From Cannabis sativa as an Antiviral Agent Against Key Shrimp Pathogens in Aquaculture.",
      "abstract": "Shrimp aquaculture plays a crucial role in global food production but is increasingly threatened by viral and microsporidian pathogens such as White Spot Syndrome Virus (WSSV), Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei (EHP) and Infectious Hypodermal and Haematopoietic Necrosis Virus (IHHNV). Conventional reliance on antibiotics to combat these infections has raised serious concerns regarding antimicrobial resistance, environmental contamination and food safety. Additionally, environmental stressors such as salinity shifts and poor water quality exacerbate disease outbreaks, leading to severe production losses across Asia and Latin America. To explore eco-friendly therapeutic alternatives, this study assessed the antiviral potential of cannabidiol (CBD), a bioactive compound extracted from Cannabis sativa seed oil, identified through GC-MS analysis. Using molecular docking techniques, we evaluated CBD's interactions with key viral proteins: VP28 of WSSV, the tubulin \u03b2-chain of EHP and the capsid protein of IHHNV. The docking results revealed strong binding affinities of -6.61\u2009kcal/mol (EHP), -6.72\u2009kcal/mol (IHHNV) and -5.38\u2009kcal/mol (WSSV), indicating stable and potentially inhibitory interactions. Structural models were retrieved from RCSB PDB and SwissModel, while ligand preparation and docking were performed using AutoDock 4.2. CBD also demonstrated favourable pharmacokinetic and safety profiles, with predictions indicating no mutagenicity, hepatotoxicity or cardiotoxicity, and acceptable drug-likeness characteristics. Compared to other plant-derived compounds previously tested in shrimp disease models, CBD exhibited superior binding stability, more interaction residues and better bioavailability scores. These findings highlight CBD as a promising dual-function agent, capable of both modulating shrimp immunity and directly inhibiting key viral pathogens. These findings highlight cannabidiol (CBD) as a promising dual-action compound, with the potential to both enhance shrimp immune responses and exert direct antiviral effects against key pathogens. This study lays a robust groundwork for future in\u00a0vivo validations, formulation strategies and regulatory frameworks, ultimately supporting the development of sustainable, precision-based aquaculture health management.",

      "abstract": "Cannabidiol (CBD) is a phytocannabinoid which holds benefit for anxiety-related disorders. This study evaluated the effects of a lipid-based CBD nanoemulsion in anxiety- and panic-related responses. Male Wistar rats were acutely or chronically orally treated (21\u00a0days) with CBD (2.5 and 5\u00a0mg/kg, 1\u00a0mL/kg) or vehicle (1\u00a0mL/kg) and tested in the avoidance and escape tasks of the elevated T-maze (ETM) and in an open field. We quantified chronic CBD in the whole brain of the animals and evaluated FosB/deltaFosB immunoreactivity (Fos-ir) in non-serotonergic cells of the dorsal raphe (DR) and periaqueductal gray matter and in serotonergic cells of the DR. Acute CBD did not alter behavior. Chronic CBD 2.5\u00a0mg yielded (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SEM) 64.25\u00a0\u00b1\u00a028.82 and CBD 5.0\u00a0mg 21.22\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.46\u00a0ng of CBD/g of brain tissue. Chronic CBD 2.5\u00a0mg induced anxiolytic and panicolytic-like effects. Immunohistochemical results showed that chronic CBD significantly decreased Fos-ir in the lateral and dorsomedial periaqueductal gray and in the dorsal region (DRD) and ventrolateral periqueductal gray/lateral wings (lwDR) of the DR. Fos-ir in the dorsolateral periaqueductal gray was only decreased by CBD 2.5\u00a0mg. CBD increased tryptophan hydroxylase immunoreactivity in the lwDR and DRD. CBD 2.5\u00a0mg also increased tryptophan hydroxylase immunoreactivity in the ventral DR. Additionally, double immunostaining was increased in the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray/lwDR by CBD 2.5\u00a0mg. These results point to the anxiolytic- and panicolytic-like effects of a CBD lipid-based nanoemulsion and suggest that they may be related to the modulation of DR serotonin neurons.",

Cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive compound from Cannabis sativa, has shown anticancer properties. This review analyzes CBD's therapeutic potential in HCC, focusing on mechanisms, preclinical/clinical findings, and integration into treatment strategies. A systematic search (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar) up to March 2025 identified 16 relevant studies (in vitro, in vivo, clinical). CBD exerts antitumor effects via multiple pathways, including apoptosis, autophagy regulation, metastasis suppression, and tumor microenvironment modulation. CBD interacts with the endocannabinoid system (ECS), inhibits oncogenic signaling (PI3K/AKT/mTOR), and enhances chemotherapeutic efficacy (sorafenib, cabozantinib). Studies show CBD induces pyroptosis via caspase-3/GSDME, and modulates autophagy by inhibiting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. It also sensitizes HCC cells to sorafenib and cabozantinib. Preclinical results are promising, but clinical studies are limited. Challenges like bioavailability and potential hepatotoxicity require investigation. Future research should optimize formulations, determine dosing, and conduct clinical trials to validate CBD's efficacy/safety in HCC patients. Validated CBD could offer an innovative HCC management option.",

      "abstract": "Despite their growing popularity, cannabis vape products remain understudied. Cannabis vape cartridges are used with battery-powered devices that aerosolize cannabis flower extracts containing high concentrations of cannabinoids such as THC. These types of products are commonly known as cannabis distillates. The potency of these products presents challenges in establishing effective dosing for preclinical studies. Currently, there are no established, standardized preclinical models for testing the safety and efficacy of these products in ways analogous to human use patterns. Thus, the in vivo cannabis distillate exposure regime required to achieve physiologically relevant doses in comparison to what is achieved in humans remains undetermined. To address this gap, a standardized preclinical murine model for inhalation of vaporized cannabis distillates has been developed using a computer-controlled delivery system. This protocol details procedures to administer cannabis vape distillates using a regimented puff topography to mice by a nose-only exposure tower. Methods to monitor mouse behavioral outcomes post-exposure and the utilization of a semi-quantitative ELISA to confirm THC delivery into the systemic circulation are also provided. This protocol will allow for the investigation of the pulmonary and systemic responses to cannabis vape distillate products by researchers interested in exploring the impact of cannabis vaping using real-world delivery protocols, thereby providing an opportunity for rigorous safety and therapeutic evaluation.",

      "title": "Innovations in Cannabis Delivery Systems: A Patent Review (2012-2024).",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Cannabis sativa has been cultivated for over 11,700 years, originating in Central and Southeast Asia, and has been used for medical, recreational, and religious purposes. Among its therapeutic potentials, it is notable for its capacity to alleviate pain, nausea, anxiety, and more. The plant's primary secondary metabolites are cannabinoids, which interact with the endocannabinoid system to produce these effects. However, due to the dosage variability and the secondary effects associated with a lack of targeted action, their medical use is limited, creating the need for effective delivery systems. METHODOLOGY: This systematic patent review on cannabis drug delivery systems was conducted using patents retrieved from the Espacenet database. The search employed the keywords \"Cannabis\" and \"Delivery,\" along with the IPC classification code A61, to filter patents filed between 2012 and 2024. This initial search yielded 99 patents, which were further screened to identify 15 patents that met the inclusion criteria. RESULTS: Of the selected patents, most originated from the United States, followed by Canada, international patents (WIPO), and China. A notable increase in patent filings occurred in 2022, coinciding with the peak in scientific publications on the topic. This trend indicates a growing interest in the design of cannabis delivery systems. DISCUSSION: The historical importance and therapeutic potential of Cannabis sativa are welldocumented, yet modern medical use remains restricted due to pharmacokinetic limitations. Delivery systems such as extracellular vesicles, microneedles, and emulsions have been developed to improve the bioavailability and stability of cannabinoids. Extracellular vesicles facilitate targeted, noninvasive delivery of cannabinoids to the central nervous system. Microneedles offer a painless method for transdermal administration, overcoming skin barrier limitations. Emulsions improve the solubility and bioavailability of lipophilic cannabinoids, making them suitable for various administration routes. CONCLUSION: Since 2012, there has been considerable growth in patents and publications related to cannabis drug delivery systems, driven by the therapeutic potential of cannabinoids. Innovations in delivery systems like emulsions, microneedles, and extracellular vesicles aim to improve the pharmacokinetics and therapeutic efficacy of cannabis-derived compounds, representing a shift towards medical cannabis applications.",

      "abstract": "Cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive phytocannabinoid derived from Cannabis sativa, has emerged as a promising therapeutic agent due to its diverse pharmacological properties, including potent anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, and immunomodulatory effects. CBD modulates immune responses, including the regulation of T cell activity, induction of macrophage apoptosis, suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and modulation of signaling pathways involved in inflammation and immune homeostasis. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases to identify relevant preclinical and clinical studies on CBD's immunomodulatory effects. Preclinical and clinical studies demonstrate its efficacy in treating autoimmune diseases such as Type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease, along with its potential in neuropathic pain and cancer therapy. Recent advancements in nanotechnology-based delivery systems have further enhanced CBD's therapeutic potential by improving its solubility, bioavailability, and targeted delivery, enabling innovative approaches for wound healing, inflammation management, and cancer treatment. However, challenges such as variability in immune responses, limited long-term safety data, and potential drug-drug interactions persist. This review comprehensively examines CBD's pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and immunomodulatory mechanisms, highlighting its clinical potential, existing limitations, and future directions in advancing its integration into precision medicine and immune regulation.",

      "abstract": "Phytocannabinoids are natural products with highly promising pharmaceutical potential, mainly known from the plant Cannabis\u00a0sativa. However, their bioavailability is limited due to their high lipophilicity. Modification through glycosylation is known to improve the water solubility and stability of molecules. Enzymatic glycosylation requires specific enzymes with high catalytic activity in combination with efficient production systems. To date, only a few glycosyltransferases with activity toward cannabinoids have been described. In this study, we explore the substrate spectrum of the promiscuous UDP-glycosyltransferase CrUGT74AN3 from Catharanthus\u00a0roseus and demonstrate activity towards a broad range of cannabinoids and their biosynthetic intermediates. The highest activity was observed using cannabidiol (CBD) as an acceptor molecule. In addition, we show efficient biotransformation of CBD in an engineered Saccharomyces\u00a0cerevisiae strain. We investigate the influence of the hydrolytic activity of endogenous glucosidases and identify the UDP-glucose supply as a limiting factor in the yeast system. The co-expression of CrUGT74AN3 and a cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase from Bacillus\u00a0licheniformis in the engineered yeast strain led to the production of CBD-glycosides with up to six glucose moieties from CBD and cyclodextrin in\u00a0vivo. Finally, we confirm the applicability of the engineered yeast systems to other cannabinoids using cannabigerol and cannabinol.",

      "title": "Acute cannabis intoxication among the paediatric population.",
      "abstract": "This narrative review synthesizes the toxicological, clinical and medico-legal aspects of paediatric cannabis intoxication. By providing a comprehensive overview, it aims to inform future research, guide policymaking, and enhance clinical and toxicological practice in addressing this growing public health concern. The pharmacokinetics of cannabinoid ingestion in children are significantly influenced by the immaturity of their gastrointestinal tract and metabolic enzyme systems, resulting in altered oral bioavailability. Clinical data indicate that \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-related effects in paediatricpaediatric patients typically emerge within 2\u00a0hours of ingestion, with more severe symptoms developing within 4\u00a0hours. The endocannabinoid system (ECS) undergoes significant developmental changes, with marked differences in cannabinoid receptor expression and distribution across fetal, neonatal, and adult brains. During neurodevelopment, CB1 receptors exhibit unique expression patterns, including transient localization in brainstem regions critical for neurovegetative functions. These developmental dynamics likely explain children's heightened sensitivity to THC's neurological and neurovegetative effects, often resulting in more severe outcomes compared to adults. The reliable detection of cannabinoids involves integrating screening methods with confirmatory analytical techniques. Urine immunoassay testing is widely considered an helpful toolto assess a previous exposure, becoming positive within 3-4\u00a0h of ingestion. However, this method is prone to false positives. Plasma THC concentration, when measured close to the event, offers valuable insights into the quantity ingested and the correlation between exposure and clinical outcomes in the impairment window. Hair analysis, while useful for distinguishing between acute and chronic use, is susceptible to various biases. The rising incidence of acute cannabis intoxication in children underscores the urgent need for targeted public health interventions and stricter regulatory frameworks. Preventive measures such as child-resistant packaging, public education campaigns, and cannabis use screening during pregnancy are essential to mitigate risks. Clinicians should consider THC exposure in the differential diagnosis of children presenting with unexplained neurological, immune, or metabolic symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Neuropathic pain, a complex and often devastating condition, poses significant challenges for its effective management. Despite promising research on various cannabis formulations and delivery methods for neuropathic pain, significant gaps remain in our knowledge. While inhaled cannabis shows analgesic effects and alternative delivery methods may improve bioavailability, oral formulations have yielded mixed results, often limited by small sample sizes and placebo effects. Therefore, further research is essential to optimize cannabis formulations, identify responder profiles to tailor treatments effectively, and, most critically, confirm the long-term safety and efficacy of cannabis-based therapies in managing NP. This review article aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the therapeutic potential of cannabis-based medicines, with a particular focus on cannabinoids. This review, though not systematic, examines 11 clinical studies, specifically Randomised Clinical Trials) published from 2014 to 2024, highlighting the efficacy of numerous cannabis formulations, in alleviating neuropathic pain. Key findings show that cannabinoids can reduce pain perception, improve patient quality of life, and mitigate other symptoms associated with neuropathic pain. The synergistic effects of tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol are discussed, emphasizing their ability to enhance analgesic effects, while potentially reducing the psychoactive side effects of tetrahydrocannabinol. This review emphasizes the importance of the personalized approach to improve therapeutic outcomes. Limitations of the existing research focusing on cannabis for neuropathic pain are limited by heterogeneity, lack of standardization, small sample sizes, and reliance on subjective outcomes, impacting the reliability and generalizability of findings. However, this exhaustive review aims to inform clinicians and researchers about the evolving role of cannabis in contemporary pain management strategies, illustrating the diverse pharmacological profiles of cannabinoids and their potential as adjunct therapies for neuropathic pain management.",

In this review, potential nano-formulated natural drugs from plants such as Ginseng, Pistacia lentiscus, Amaranthus hypochondriacus, and Cannabis sativa in the treatment of melanoma are discussed. We discuss various characteristics of nanoformulations, including liposomes and nanoemulsions, with respect to their ability in enhancing drug delivery and bioavailability. Key mechanisms of action including reactive oxygen species modulation, apoptotic signaling induction, immune modulation through TLR4/MyD88, and inhibition of angiogenesis by VEGF pathways are discussed.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cannabis sativa L. with a rich history of traditional medicinal use, has garnered significant attention in contemporary research for its potential therapeutic applications in various human diseases, including pain, inflammation, cancer, and osteoarthritis. However, the specific molecular targets and mechanisms underlying the synergistic effects of its diverse phytochemical constituents remain elusive. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for developing targeted, effective cannabis-based therapies. METHODS: To investigate the molecular targets and pathways involved in the synergistic effects of cannabis compounds, we utilized DRIFT, a deep learning model that leverages attention-based neural networks to predict compound-target interactions. We considered both whole plant extracts and specific plant-based formulations. Predicted targets were then mapped to the Reactome pathway database to identify the biological processes affected. To facilitate the prediction of molecular targets and associated pathways for any user-specified cannabis formulation, we developed CANDI (Cannabis-derived compound Analysis and Network Discovery Interface), a web-based server. This platform offers a user-friendly interface for researchers and drug developers to explore the therapeutic potential of cannabis compounds. RESULTS: Our analysis using DRIFT and CANDI successfully identified numerous molecular targets of cannabis compounds, many of which are involved in pathways relevant to pain, inflammation, cancer, and other diseases. The CANDI server enables researchers to predict the molecular targets and affected pathways for any specific cannabis formulation, providing valuable insights for developing targeted therapies. CONCLUSIONS: By combining computational approaches with knowledge of traditional cannabis use, we have developed the CANDI server, a tool that allows us to harness the therapeutic potential of cannabis compounds for the effective treatment of various disorders. By bridging traditional pharmaceutical development with cannabis-based medicine, we propose a novel approach for botanical-based treatment modalities.",

      "abstract": "AIMS: Reducing combustible cigarette smoking is a major public health concern. Research identifies both electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) and cannabis use as factors that are related to combustible cigarette cessation. The current study examined whether using substances in similar ways (e.g., inhaling them) triggers the urge to smoke, thereby undermining attempts to quit. DESIGN: Analyses examined how using ENDS and smoking or vaping cannabis, both separately and together, were associated with reductions in daily combustible cigarette smoking among young adult smokers. PARTICIPANTS: Three waves of data from the Community Youth Development Study, including 909 participants who reported daily cigarette smoking at age 23, 26, and/or 28, were included in analyses. SETTING: Participants were dispersed throughout 48 US states. MEASUREMENTS: Latent growth modeling was used to model daily cigarette smoking over time. Models using past-month ENDS use, past-month smoking/vaping cannabis, and past-month co-use of ENDS and cannabis (using ENDS and smoking/vaping cannabis within the past month) as time-varying covariates were tested. FINDINGS: Over time, there was a tendency towards cessation of daily combustible cigarette use among this smoking sample. Smoking/vaping cannabis was associated with a decreased rate of daily combustible cigarette cessation among the sample, whereas ENDS use was associated with an increased rate of daily smoking cessation. The predicted additive effect of using ENDS and smoking/vaping cannabis was not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Among young adult daily cigarette smokers, smoking cannabis, on its own, poses a risk to quitting combustible cigarettes, while using ENDS may promote cigarette cessation, possibly through substitution.",

      "abstract": "Cannabidiol (CBD), one of the main actives from Cannabis sativa has been perpetually explored lately for its therapeutic effects. Its main attributes, such as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, snowball into pain management, epilepsy and seizure alleviation, anxiety relief, as well as numerous other implications through the entire metabolism. However, conventional administration routes challenge its therapeutic potential, with reported poor water solubility, hepatic degradation, gastric instability and erratic bioavailability observed in oral administration. As a result, the transdermal delivery systems have emerged as a promising alternative to oral or inhaled routes, offering improved bioavailability and targeted effects. The medical use of CBD throughout Europe, UK, USA or Australia is extensive and usually represented by pharmaceutical preparations recommended after conventional treatment routs fail. The non-medical use is limited by each country's own legislation, a wider range of products being available, but the irregular regulatory landscape coupled with the growing market of cannabinoid-infused products, emphasizes the need for standardized formulations and further clinical research. The present work critically examines the transdermal administration of cannabidiol, explores the skin's potential as a route and the strategies involved in using it for systemic targeting. We highlighted key challenges and provided insights into CBD`s variable bioavailability based on different administration routes and methods, thus compiling a literature-based absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) study. We also explore the role of the endocannabinoid system, its function in various medical conditions, and the therapeutic effects associated with CBD, particularly in light of the varying legislation across countries. While the breadth of potential benefits is compelling, it is essential to emphasize the ongoing nature of CBD research as individual responses to it can vary significantly.",

Compared to single device use, participants who used multiple devices were more likely to currently smoke cigarettes (two 32.5\u2009% vs. three+ 44.0\u2009% vs. one 22.4\u2009%, p\u2009<\u20090.0001), use multiple nicotine products and cannabis in the past 30 days (two 28.3\u2009% vs. three+ 37.4\u2009% vs. one 17.7\u2009%, p\u2009<\u20090.0001), use disposable devices (salt, no adjustable settings) (two 44.3\u2009% vs. three+ 56.5\u2009% vs. one 20.4\u2009%, p\u2009<\u20090.0001) and nicotine salt liquid (two 70.2\u2009% vs. three+ 77.3\u2009% vs. one 58.9\u2009%, p\u2009<\u20090.0001). CONCLUSIONS: About half of adults frequently using ENDS used more than one device. Multiple device use was associated with current cigarette smoking, multiple substance use, and use of disposable devices as their most commonly used ENDS. Understanding multiple ENDS device use can help contextualize real-world use and inform potential benefits and unintended consequences of future regulations.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Although Canada legalized cannabis beverages in 2019, most available research on acute cannabis intoxication derives from dried flower and edible products. The distinct bioavailability and pharmacokinetic properties of phytocannabinoids ingested from beverages, however, contribute to significantly different acute and long-term effects that need to be better understood to ensure consumer safety. OBJECTIVE: This review investigates existing cannabis beverage literature, with a particular focus on acute intoxication effects. METHOD:  RESULTS: Human studies report aversive acute subjective and physiological effects induced by cannabis beverages in healthy, infrequent users. Beverages also showed inaccurate cannabinoid labeling, posing potential risks to consumers. This review highlights the paucity and inconsistency of available research, further exacerbated by the sheer diversity of formulations investigated, while beginning to address some questions surrounding the safety and risks associated with cannabis beverages. CONCLUSIONS: Given the extensive differences in effects across cannabis-infused beverages, and the growing 'drinkables' market, it is essential that more studies directly examine both acute and long-term impacts of cannabis beverage consumption.",

      "abstract": "Cannabidiol (CBD) is a natural product isolated from the Cannabis sativa plant that was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) for the treatment of resistant epilepsy. Despite its therapeutic potential, CBD's clinical application is limited by its poor aqueous solubility and low oral bioavailability. The primary aim of this research was to enhance the aqueous solubility and oral bioavailability of CBD by developing nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) using conventional hot homogenization method (CHH). In the current study, nine CBD NLC formulations were developed through CHH, of which, NLC5 emerged as the most promising formulation, exhibiting high CBD entrapment efficiency (99.23%), particle size of 207\u00a0nm, a polydispersity index of 0.19, and a zeta potential of -26 mV. Additionally, drug release testing for NLC5 showed a high CBD release rate of more than 90% within 15\u00a0min, indicating an enhancement of CBD dissolving rate compared to pure CBD. The in vivo pharmacokinetic study of NLC5 formulation showed 27% CBD oral bioavailability. Furthermore, Stability studies conducted at 4\u00a0\u00b0C and 25\u00a0\u00b0C on this formulation over three months, revealed consistent parameters, underscoring the robustness of the formulation. In conclusion, the successful formulation of CBD-loaded NLCs resulted in improved CBD release rate, enhanced oral bioavailability of CBD, and maintained stability, making it a promising approach for the effective delivery of CBD.",

      "abstract": "The worldwide legalization of medicinal cannabis has led to an increased use of products made by commercial operators. These products often contain minor cannabinoids such as cannabinol (CBN) which are advertised to improve sleep. Products are also available in which CBN is combined with conventional therapies, with a common product containing both CBN and the widely used sleep-aid melatonin. The combination of CBN and melatonin provides potential for a pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction (DDI) given that cannabinoids are known to inhibit drug-metabolizing enzymes. Indeed, we recently reported that CBN potently inhibited the CYP1A2-mediated metabolism of caffeine. CYP1A2 is the major hepatic enzyme involved in the metabolism of melatonin; thus, in this study, we aimed to examine whether CBN inhibited CYP1A2-mediated metabolism of melatonin in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo. We found CBN potently inhibited CYP1A2-mediated metabolism of melatonin and increased the apparent oral bioavailability of melatonin in mice with a four-fold increase in the plasma melatonin exposure. Our results provide an additional example of a potential DDI involving melatonin.",

This clinical investigation evaluated the therapeutic efficacy and safety profile of a novel transdermal medical cannabis formulation (THC:CBD:CBN) in treating painful DPN of the lower extremities. METHODS: This phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial was conducted at Don Chan Hospital, Thailand, enrolling 100 participants over a 12-week intervention period. Using a computer-generated randomization sequence, participants were allocated to receive either the standardized cannabis formulation or a matched placebo. The primary outcome measure comprised pain intensity assessment using the validated Thai version of the Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (NPSI-T). Secondary outcomes encompassed treatment-emergent adverse events and dermatological manifestations. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Version 28.0, incorporating generalized estimating equation (GEE) modeling and Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA). The study protocol received approval from the Institutional Review Board of Khon Kaen University and the Kalasin Provincial Public Health Office Ethics Committee, with trial registration in the Thai Clinical Trials Registry. RESULTS: The intervention group demonstrated statistically significant reductions in NPSI-T scores across all measured dimensions ( CONCLUSION: This novel transdermal medical cannabis formulation (THC:CBD:CBN) demonstrated significant therapeutic efficacy in ameliorating painful DPN symptoms while maintaining a favorable safety profile.

Its antioxidant activity rivals that of vitamin E, while its anti-inflammatory effects are also remarkable. Additionally, CBDA has been shown to effectively reduce nausea and emetic attacks. As a more natural and water-soluble alternative to CBD, CBDA offers improved bioavailability and absorption. However, despite its promising potential, the development of effective CBDA delivery systems is still in its early stages. Among the various materials suitable for drug delivery, alginate is a widely used biopolymer due to its abundance and common availability in nature. This study aimed to develop an efficient CBDA delivery carrier using a microflow-dripping method to microencapsulate CBDA into alginate carriers (Alg-CBDA). The antioxidant, antimicrobial, and cytotoxicity properties of these Alg-CBDA capsules were then evaluated. Our results demonstrated that encapsulating CBDA within alginate capsules yielded a novel multifunctional biomaterial with prolonged antioxidant activity up to 72\u00a0h and antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria. Furthermore, the encapsulation process significantly reduced CBDA's cytotoxicity, broadening its potential applications. To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating the advantages of CBDA within a drug delivery framework.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patient portal secure messaging allows patients to describe health-related behaviors in ways that may not be sufficiently captured in standard electronic health record (EHR) documentation, but little is known about how cannabis is discussed on this platform. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify patient and provider secure messages that discussed cannabis and contextualize these discussions over periods before and after its legalization for medical purposes in Pennsylvania. METHODS: We examined 382,982 secure messages sent by 15,340 patients and 6101 providers from an integrated health delivery system in Pennsylvania, United States, from January 2012 to June 2022. We used an unsupervised natural language processing approach to construct a lexicon that identified messages explicitly discussing cannabis. We then conducted a qualitative content analysis on a random sample of identified messages to understand the medical reasons behind patients' use, the primary purposes of the cannabis-related discussions, and changes in these purposes over time. RESULTS: We identified 1782 messages sent by 1098 patients (7.2% of total patients in the study) and 800 messages sent by 430 providers (7% of total providers in the study) as explicitly discussing cannabis. The most common medical reasons for use stated by patients in 190 sampled messages included pain or a pain-related condition (50.5% of messages), anxiety (13.7% of messages), and sleep (11.1% of messages). We coded 56 different purposes behind the mentions of cannabis in patient messages and 33 purposes in 100 sampled provider messages. In years before the legalization (2012-2016), patient and provider messages (n=20 for both) were primarily driven by discussions about cannabis screening results (38.9% and 76.5% of messages, respectively). In the years following legalization (2017-2022), patient messages (n=170) primarily involved seeking assistance to facilitate medical use (35.2% of messages) and reporting current use (25.3% of messages). Provider messages (n=80) were driven by giving assistance with medical marijuana access (27.5% of messages) and stating that they were unable to refer, prescribe or recommend medical marijuana (26.3% of messages). CONCLUSIONS: Patients showed a willingness to discuss cannabis use over patient portal secure messages and expressed interest in use after the legalization of medical marijuana. Some providers responded to patient inquiries with assistance in obtaining access to medical marijuana, while others cautioned patients on the risks of use. Insight into cannabis-related discussions through secure messages can help health systems determine opportunities to improve care processes around patients' cannabis use, and providers should be supported to communicate accurate and consistent information.",

      "abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most prevalent primary brain tumor in adults and is known for its rapid proliferation and infiltrative nature. Current therapeutic strategies include surgical resection followed by radio- and chemotherapy. Still, they are hindered by GBM biological characteristics and physical-chemical properties of chemotherapeutic drugs, leading to limited efficacy and poor prognosis. Cannabinoids have emerged as potential anti-GBM agents, exhibiting antiangiogenic, antimetastatic, and antiproliferative effects. However, their hydrophobicity and poor oral bioavailability pose significant challenges for clinical applications. This study evaluates the potential of nanocarriers in enhancing the solubility and targeted delivery of cannabinoids for GBM therapy. The innovative combination of nanotechnology with cannabinoid-based treatment offers a promising strategy to improve therapeutic outcomes. We addressed the application of nanocarriers to deliver cannabinoids, which can enhance passage across the blood-brain barrier and enable targeted therapy. Studies demonstrate the potential of nanocarriers in improving solubility, stability, and controlled release of cannabinoids, highlighting the advancements in nanocarrier design for optimized delivery to glioma cells. Cannabinoids can exert their antitumor effect, including the induction of apoptosis through the ceramide and p8-regulated pathways and the modulation of immune responses. The evidence found in this study supports the potential of cannabinoid-based nanotechnologies in GBM therapeutic regimens as a strategy to enhance its efficacy and patient outcomes.",

Despite the availability of many antiglaucoma drugs, a significant proportion of patients may experience worsening of the disease. Hence, there is a need for newer antiglaucoma drugs. SUMMARY: Natural and synthetic derivatives of cannabis plants have been studied in the treatment of glaucoma since the 1970s. This review describes the potential mechanisms of the cannabinoids in the treatment of glaucoma, summarizes the findings of clinical studies describing the efficacy of these compounds, and describes the adverse effects observed with the various cannabinoid formulations evaluated in clinical studies of glaucoma in healthy volunteers and patients. The implications of these findings in terms of the potential clinical status of cannabinoids in the treatment of glaucoma and the challenges involved have also been described. KEY MESSAGES: Cannabinoids lower intraocular pressure. However, the effect is short-lived. There is also a lack of well-formulated ocular delivery system. The available evidence is inadequate to recommend the use of cannabinoids for the routine treatment of glaucoma.",

      "abstract": "Recently, the anti-tumor effects of cannabis extract on various cancers have attracted the attention of researchers. Here, we report a nanoemulsion (NE) composition designed to enhance the delivery of two active components in cannabis extracts (\u22069-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and Cannabidiol (CBD)) in an animal model of glioblastoma. The efficacy of the NE containing the two drugs (NED) was compared with the bulk drugs and carrier (NE without the drugs) using the C6 tumor model in rats. Hemocompatibility factors (RBC, MCV, MCH, MCHC, RDW, PPP, PT and PTT) were studied to determine the potential in vivo toxicity of NED. The optimized NED with mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD diameter 29\u2009\u00b1\u20096\u00a0nm was obtained. It was shown that by administering the drugs in the form of NED, the hemocompatibility increased. Cytotoxicity studies indicated that the NE without the active components (i.e. mixture of surfactants and oil) was the most cytotoxic group, while the bulk group had no toxicity. From the in vivo MRI and survival studies, the NED group had maximum efficacy (with ~4 times smaller tumor volume on day 7 of treatment, compared with the control. Also, survival time of the control, bulk drug, NE and NED were 9, 4, 12.5 and 51 days, respectively) with no important adverse effects. In conclusion, the NE containing cannabis extract could be introduced as an effective treatment in reducing brain glioblastoma tumor progression.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to examine the association between food insecurity and substance use among young adults aged 18-25 in the U.S. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was completed by a diverse sample of 1024 young adults (50.2\u00a0% female; 62\u00a0% non-white; m age\u00a0=\u00a021.7[SD\u00a0=\u00a02.26]) between January-April 2022. Logistic regression analyses were used to examine the association between food insecurity and current cigarette use, Electronic Nicotine Delivery System (ENDS) use, cannabis use, alcohol use, and binge drinking controlling for socio-demographic and economic factors, mental health, and experiences of discrimination. RESULTS: Nearly 70\u00a0% of participants reported being food insecure over the past year. Substance use was also common: 45.9\u00a0% of participants reported current cigarette use, 50.9\u00a0% ENDS use, 57\u00a0% cannabis use, 65.9\u00a0% alcohol use, and 50.4\u00a0% engaged in binge drinking in the past two weeks. Being food insecure was associated with greater odds of cigarette use (OR\u00a0=\u00a02.49, 95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a0[1.77, 3.50]), ENDS use (OR\u00a0=\u00a02.18, 95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a0[1.58, 3.01]), cannabis use (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.73, 95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a0[1.26, 2.37]), alcohol use (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.60, 95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a0[1.16, 2.19]) and binge drinking (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.98, 95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a0[1.44, 2.72]), controlling for all other factors. CONCLUSION: Food insecurity may serve as an important indicator of substance use among young adults. Practitioners should consider screening for food insecurity, providing information about food access, and developing interventions to address food insecurity among the young adults with whom they work. Future research should examine these associations prospectively to better understand how food insecurity may contribute to the initiation and/or escalation of substance use.",

      "title": "A new cannabigerol derivative, LE-127/2, induces autophagy mediated cell death in human cutaneous melanoma cells.",
      "abstract": "Despite the targeted- and immunotherapies used in the past decade, survival rate among patients with metastatic melanoma remains low, therefore, melanoma is responsible for the majority of skin cancer-related deaths. The ongoing investigation of natural antitumor agents, the nonpsychoactive cannabinoid, cannabigerol (CBG) found in Cannabis sativa is emerging as a promising candidate. CBG offers a potential therapeutic role in the treatment of melanoma demonstrating cell growth inhibition in some tumors. Its low water solubility and bioavailability hinder the potential effectiveness. To address these challenges, a modified CBG, namely LE-127/2 was synthesized by Mannich-type reaction. The aim was to investigate the effect of this novel compound on cell proliferation as well as the mechanism of cell death with a particular focus on autophagy and apoptosis. Human cutan melanoma cell lines, WM35, A2058 and WM3000 were utilized for the present study. Cell proliferation of the cells after the treatment with LE-127/2, parent CBG or vemurafenib was assessed by Cell Titer Blue Assay. Cells were treated with a 1.25-80 \u00b5M of the above-mentioned compounds, and it was found that at 20 \u03bcM of all drugs showed a comparable effective inhibition of cell proliferation, however, vemurafenib and CBG proved to be more effective than LE-127/2. In addition, clonogenic cell survival assays were performed to examine the inhibitory effect of LE-127/2 on the colony formation ability of melanoma cell lines. Cells treated with 20 \u00b5M of LE-127/2 for 14 days showed about a 50% suppression of clonogenic cell survival. LE-127/2 exerted the most intensive inhibition on A2058 cell colonies. Furthermore, notably, LDH cytotoxicity assay performed on HaCaT cell line, proved LE-127/2 to be cytotoxic only at higher concentration, such as 80 \u03bcM, while the parent CBG was cytotoxic at concentration as low as 5 \u03bcM, suggesting that the new CBG derivative as a drug candidate may be applied in human pharmacotherapy without causing a substantial damage in intact epidermal cells. Analysis of protein expression revealed the impact of LE-127/2 on the expression of basic proteins (LC-3, Beclin-1 and p62) involved in the process of autophagy in the three different melanoma cell lines studied. Elevated expression of these proteins was detected as a result of LE-127/2 (20 \u00b5M) treatment. LE-127/2 also induced the expression of some proteins involved in apoptosis, and it is particularly noteworthy the increased level of cleaved PARP. Based on the results obtained, it can be concluded that LE-127/2 induced autophagy could lead to the inhibition of cell proliferation and death in melanoma cells.",

      "abstract": "Medical cannabis has potential therapeutic benefits in managing pain, anxiety, depression, and neurological and movement disorders. Phytocannabinoids derived from the cannabis plant are responsible for their pharmacological and therapeutic properties. However, the complexity of cannabis components, especially cannabinoids, poses a challenge to effective medicinal administration. Even with the increasing acceptance of cannabis-based medicines, achieving consistent bioavailability and targeted distribution remains difficult. Conventional administration methods are plagued by solubility and absorption problems requiring innovative solutions. After conducting a thorough review of research papers and patents, it has become evident that nanotechnology holds great promise as a solution. The comprehensive review of 36 research papers has yielded valuable insights, with 7 papers reporting enhanced bioavailability, while others have focused on improvements in release, solubility, and stability. Additionally, 19 patents have been analyzed, of which 7 specifically claim enhanced bioavailability, while the remaining patents describe various formulation methods. These patents outline effective techniques for encapsulating cannabis using nanocarriers, effectively addressing solubility and controlled release. Studies on the delivery of cannabis using nanocarriers focus on improving bioavailability, prolonging release, and targeting specific areas. This synthesis highlights the potential of nanotechnology to enhance cannabis therapies and pave the way for innovative interventions and precision medicine.",

In this work, we describe the encapsulation of CBD in solid and hollow pH-sensitive poly(4-vinylpyridine) (solid@p4VP and hollow@p4VP) nanoparticles, and temperature-sensitive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (solid@pNIPAM and hollow@pNIPAM) nanoparticles for transport and release CBD in a controlled manner. The CBD loading into these smart polymeric systems was effective and their release profiles, solubility and resistance to stomach and intestinal conditions were evaluated, showing satisfactory properties and improved bioavailability with respect to free CBD. Finally, the A549 human lung cancer cell line was used as lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cellular model to carry out preliminary assays of the in\u2005vitro activity of the vehiculized CBD. For all these studies, synthetic CBD was employed, for which a new efficient and scalable synthesis of cannabinoids has been developed.",

The last time the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was tasked with regulating a new product occurred with 2009's Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, which created the Center for Tobacco Products (CTP). Thus, the time is ripe to review the history of CTP with particular attention to difficulties the nascent center faced in regulating novel products such as e-cigarettes or electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS). Specifically, FDA has struggled with defining its scope of authority, determining which review pathway(s) to utilize, and promulgating timely and transparent product standards for marketing authorization-all of which offer lessons for improving cannabis product oversight and enforcement.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND:  METHODS: To investigate the molecular targets and pathways involved in the synergistic effects of cannabis compounds, we utilized DRIFT, a deep learning model that leverages attention-based neural networks to predict compound-target interactions. We considered both whole plant extracts and specific plant-based formulations. Predicted targets were then mapped to the Reactome pathway database to identify the biological processes affected. To facilitate the prediction of molecular targets and associated pathways for any user-specified cannabis formulation, we developed CANDI (Cannabis-derived compound Analysis and Network Discovery Interface), a web-based server. This platform offers a user-friendly interface for researchers and drug developers to explore the therapeutic potential of cannabis compounds. RESULTS: Our analysis using DRIFT and CANDI successfully identified numerous molecular targets of cannabis compounds, many of which are involved in pathways relevant to pain, inflammation, cancer, and other diseases. The CANDI server enables researchers to predict the molecular targets and affected pathways for any specific cannabis formulation, providing valuable insights for developing targeted therapies. CONCLUSIONS: By combining computational approaches with knowledge of traditional cannabis use, we have developed the CANDI server, a tool that allows us to harness the therapeutic potential of cannabis compounds for the effective treatment of various disorders. By bridging traditional pharmaceutical development with cannabis-based medicine, we propose a novel approach for botanical-based treatment modalities.",

Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has gained popularity in cancer treatment due it increased potency and low off-target toxicity. Studies have pointed out that the heterogeneity of MM tumours reduces the efficacy of current therapeutic approaches, including PDT, leading to high chances of recurrences post-treatment. Accumulating evidence suggests that cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive derivative of cannabis, can synergise with various anticancer agents to increase their efficacy. However, CBD demonstrates low bioavailability, which is attributed to factors relating to poor water compatibility, poor absorption and rapid metabolism. Nanotechnology offers tools that address these issues and enhance the biological efficiency and targeted specificity of anticancer agents. Herein, we highlighted the standard therapeutic modalities of MM and their pitfalls, as well as pointed out the need for further investigation into PDT combination therapy with CBD.",

      "abstract": "In this chapter we explored the growing interest in cannabinoids, particularly cannabidiol (CBD), over the last two decades due to their potential therapeutic applications in neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. CBD, a major non-psychotomimetic compound derived from Cannabis sativa, is highlighted as a safer alternative to other cannabinoids like\u00a0\u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Clinical trials have been investigating CBD formulations for conditions such as schizophrenia, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's diseases, and stress-related disorders. However, limited access to CBD-approved formulations primarily due to their high-cost and concerns about the quality of market-available products, challenges regulatory agencies globally. The pharmacokinetics of CBD, especially after oral administration, present challenges with erratic absorption and low bioavailability. CBD's \"promiscuous\" pharmacodynamics involve interactions with various targets beyond the endocannabinoid system, complicating precise dosing in therapeutic interventions. This chapter delves into CBD's dose-response curves, revealing complexities that pose challenges in clinical practice. Nanobiotechnology emerges as a promising solution, with recent developments showing improved bioavailability, stability, and reduced toxicity through nanoencapsulation of CBD. While this phytocannabinoid holds immense promise in neuropsychopharmacology, we provided a comprehensive overview of the current state of CBD research and suggests potential future directions regarding the pharmacology of CBD, harnessing the benefits of this intriguing compound.",

      "abstract": "Cannabidiol (CBD) is a non-psychoactive substance that exerts numerous pharmacological benefits, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. It has received attention as a useful substance for the treatment of intractable pain, seizures, and anxiety, and related clinical trials have continued. However, the CBD pharmacokinetic results between reports are highly variable, making it difficult to clearly identify the pharmacokinetic properties of CBD. The main purpose of this study was to identify CBD clinical pharmacokinetic properties through meta-analysis. In particular, we sought to derive valid, interpretable independent variables and interpret their pharmacokinetic parameter correlations in relation to the large inter-individual and inter-study variability in CBD pharmacokinetics. For this study, CBD-related clinical trial reports were extensively screened and intercomparisons were performed between internal data sets through systematic classification and extraction of pharmacokinetic parameter values. The candidate independent variables associated with interpretation of CBD pharmacokinetic diversity established and explored in this study were as follows: diet, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) combination, sample matrix type, liver and renal function, exposure route, dosage form, CBD exposure dose, cannabis smoking frequency, multiple exposure. The results of this study showed that CBD pharmacokinetics were influenced (increased plasma exposure by approximately 2-5 times) by diet immediately before or during CBD exposure, and that THC was not expected to have an antagonistic effect on the CBD absorption. The influence of changes in liver function would be significant in CBD pharmacokinetic diversity. Due to decreased liver function, the plasma exposure of CBD increased 2.57-5.15 times compared to healthy adults, and the half-life and clearance showed a 2.58-fold increase and a 5.15-fold decrease, respectively. CBD can be rapidly absorbed into the body (time to reach maximum concentration within 3.18\u00a0h) by oral, transdermal, and inhalation exposures, and lipid emulsification and nanoformulation of CBD will greatly improve CBD bioavailability (up to approximately 2 times). The pharmacokinetics of CBD generally follow linear kinetic characteristics. The importance of this study is that it suggests key factors that should be considered in terms of pharmacokinetics in further clinical trials and formulations of CBD in the future.",

The NTDB was used to identify burn patients from 2017 to 2021, isolating burn injuries through e-code variables. Cannabis use was documented at admission, and patients without screening data were excluded. The primary exposure variable was cannabis use, with outcomes including mortality, stroke, myocardial infarction, organ failure, timing of surgery, and post-surgical complications. Secondary outcomes included ED vital signs, length of stay, and intensive care needs. Multivariable regression models were applied to analyze the association between cannabis use and outcomes. Of 319\u2009941 burn patients, 52\u2009803 (16.5%) tested positive for cannabis. Cannabis-positive patients were more likely to be male (18% vs. 11%, p<.001) and younger (28.9 vs. 32.6\u00a0years, p<.001). They had higher rates of venothromboembolic events, required longer ICU stays, and were more likely to develop ventilator-associated pneumonia. Additionally, cannabis-positive patients had a higher incidence of organ failure (2.1% vs. 1.3%, p=.012) and reoperations (5.2% vs. 4.1%, p=.019). Cannabis use in burn patients is associated with more complex recoveries, including higher risks of complications. Integrating cannabis screening into burn care protocols and further research is essential to optimize treatment strategies.",

      "title": "Effects of five cannabis oils with different CBD: THC ratios and terpenes on hypertension, dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis, oxidative stress, and CB1 receptor in an experimental model.",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common liver disorder caused by oxidative stress and dysregulation of lipid metabolism. The endocannabinoid system (ECS), particularly the type 1 cannabinoid (CB1) receptor, plays a crucial role in NAFLD progression. Cannabinoids, such as cannabidiol (CBD) and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), along with terpenes, such as beta-myrcene and d-limonene, have shown potential therapeutic effects on liver health, particularly in reducing oxidative stress and modulating lipid metabolism. This study aimed to analyse the effects of five cannabis oils (COs), each with different CBD:THC ratios and terpenes content, on hypertension, dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis, oxidative stress, and CB1 receptor expression in an experimental model of NAFLD induced by a sucrose-rich diet (SRD) in Wistar rats for 3 weeks. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were fed either a: (1) reference diet (RD; standard commercial laboratory diet) or a: (2) sucrose-rich diet (SRD) for 3 weeks. 3 to 7 SRD\u2009+\u2009CO as following: (3) SRD\u2009+\u2009THC; (4) SRD\u2009+\u2009CBD; (5) SRD\u2009+\u2009CBD:THC 1:1; (6) SRD\u2009+\u2009CBD:THC 2:1; and (7) SRD\u2009+\u2009CBD:THC 3:1. The COs were administered orally at a dose of 1.5\u00a0mg total cannabinoids/kg body weight daily. The cannabinoid and terpenes content of all COs used in the study was determined. The terpenes found in COs were beta-myrcene, d-limonene, terpinolene, linalool, beta-caryophyllene, alpha-humulene, (-)-guaiol, (-)-alpha-bisabolol. During the experimental period, body weight, food intake and blood pressure were measured. Serum glucose, triglyceride, total cholesterol, uric acid, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (AP) levels were evaluated. Liver tissue histology, NAFLD activity score (NAS), triglyceride and cholesterol content, lipogenic enzyme activities, enzyme related to mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, reactive oxygen species (ROS), thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS), and antioxidant enzyme activities were also evaluated. The CB1 receptor expression was also determined. RESULTS: The results showed that SRD-fed rats developed hypertension, dyslipidemia, liver damage, hepatic steatosis, lipid peroxidation, and oxidative stress. This was accompanied by upregulation of liver CB1 receptor expression. CBD-rich CO, CBD:THC 1:1 ratio CO; CBD:THC 2:1 ratio CO and CBD:THC 3:1 ratio CO showed antihypertensive properties. THC-rich CO, CBD:THC 1:1 ratio CO; CBD:THC 2:1 ratio CO showed the greatest beneficial effects against hepatic steatosis and liver damage. All COs exhibited antioxidant effects in liver tissue. This was associated with normal liver CB1 receptor expression. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that COs, particularly THC-rich CO, CBD:THC ratio 1:1 CO, CBD:THC ratio 2:1 CO and terpenes, can effectively reduce dyslipidemia, liver damage and hepatic steatosis in SRD-induced NAFLD. COs with a higher proportion of CBD in their composition showed antihypertensive properties. All the COs exhibited antioxidant properties. These findings suggest that COs, especially those with CBD:THC ratios of 1:1 and 2:1 and terpenes, may represent a promising therapeutic approach for managing NAFLD and preventing its progression to more severe liver disease.",

      "title": "In Silico Assessment of Cannabidiol From Cannabis sativa as an Antiviral Agent Against Key Shrimp Pathogens in Aquaculture.",
      "abstract": "Shrimp aquaculture plays a crucial role in global food production but is increasingly threatened by viral and microsporidian pathogens such as White Spot Syndrome Virus (WSSV), Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei (EHP) and Infectious Hypodermal and Haematopoietic Necrosis Virus (IHHNV). Conventional reliance on antibiotics to combat these infections has raised serious concerns regarding antimicrobial resistance, environmental contamination and food safety. Additionally, environmental stressors such as salinity shifts and poor water quality exacerbate disease outbreaks, leading to severe production losses across Asia and Latin America. To explore eco-friendly therapeutic alternatives, this study assessed the antiviral potential of cannabidiol (CBD), a bioactive compound extracted from Cannabis sativa seed oil, identified through GC-MS analysis. Using molecular docking techniques, we evaluated CBD's interactions with key viral proteins: VP28 of WSSV, the tubulin \u03b2-chain of EHP and the capsid protein of IHHNV. The docking results revealed strong binding affinities of -6.61\u2009kcal/mol (EHP), -6.72\u2009kcal/mol (IHHNV) and -5.38\u2009kcal/mol (WSSV), indicating stable and potentially inhibitory interactions. Structural models were retrieved from RCSB PDB and SwissModel, while ligand preparation and docking were performed using AutoDock 4.2. CBD also demonstrated favourable pharmacokinetic and safety profiles, with predictions indicating no mutagenicity, hepatotoxicity or cardiotoxicity, and acceptable drug-likeness characteristics. Compared to other plant-derived compounds previously tested in shrimp disease models, CBD exhibited superior binding stability, more interaction residues and better bioavailability scores. These findings highlight CBD as a promising dual-function agent, capable of both modulating shrimp immunity and directly inhibiting key viral pathogens. These findings highlight cannabidiol (CBD) as a promising dual-action compound, with the potential to both enhance shrimp immune responses and exert direct antiviral effects against key pathogens. This study lays a robust groundwork for future in\u00a0vivo validations, formulation strategies and regulatory frameworks, ultimately supporting the development of sustainable, precision-based aquaculture health management.",

      "abstract": "Alcohol use disorder (AUD) remains a pervasive public health issue with limited effective treatments. Cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychotropic constituent of cannabis, shows promise in modulating addictive behaviors. This study investigated the effects of chronic CBD administration on alcohol dependence, withdrawal symptoms, and neurodegeneration using two complementary rodent models: chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) exposure, which models established alcohol dependence, and ethanol vapor self-administration (EVSA), which captures the volitional aspects of alcohol intake. In the CIE model, CBD reduced alcohol self-administration during acute withdrawal without affecting alcohol metabolism or locomotor activity. CBD decreased motivation for alcohol, somatic withdrawal signs, withdrawal-induced anxiety-like behaviors, and mechanical sensitivity. During extinction, CBD attenuated alcohol-seeking behavior and stress-induced reinstatement. Electrophysiological recordings revealed that CBD reversed alcohol-induced decreases in neuronal excitability in the basolateral amygdala, suggesting a mechanism involving normalization of neural function. In the EVSA model, CBD reduced voluntary alcohol intake during the escalation phase, impacting voluntary alcohol intake. This effect was specific to alcohol-related behaviors, as it did not affect saccharin self-administration. Immunohistochemical analyses showed that CBD prevented alcohol-induced neurodegeneration in the nucleus accumbens shell and dorsomedial striatum, regions implicated in the volitional control of alcohol consumption. These findings indicate that chronic CBD administration attenuates both behavioral and neurobiological facets of alcohol dependence by modulating neuronal excitability and preventing neurodegeneration, supporting its therapeutic potential for AUD and providing mechanistic insights for future research.",

      "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major cause of cancer-related mortality with limited treatment options. Cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive compound from Cannabis sativa, has shown anticancer properties. This review analyzes CBD's therapeutic potential in HCC, focusing on mechanisms, preclinical/clinical findings, and integration into treatment strategies. A systematic search (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar) up to March 2025 identified 16 relevant studies (in vitro, in vivo, clinical). CBD exerts antitumor effects via multiple pathways, including apoptosis, autophagy regulation, metastasis suppression, and tumor microenvironment modulation. CBD interacts with the endocannabinoid system (ECS), inhibits oncogenic signaling (PI3K/AKT/mTOR), and enhances chemotherapeutic efficacy (sorafenib, cabozantinib). Studies show CBD induces pyroptosis via caspase-3/GSDME, and modulates autophagy by inhibiting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. It also sensitizes HCC cells to sorafenib and cabozantinib. Preclinical results are promising, but clinical studies are limited. Challenges like bioavailability and potential hepatotoxicity require investigation. Future research should optimize formulations, determine dosing, and conduct clinical trials to validate CBD's efficacy/safety in HCC patients. Validated CBD could offer an innovative HCC management option.",

According to this analysis of 16 papers and 18 patents (2019-2024), CBD that has been nanoformulated offers improved tolerability, sustained release, and skin delivery. According to GRADE review, impacts on dermal absorption, inflammation, and wound healing demonstrated intermediate certainty, but outcomes such as skin penetration, controlled release, and safety showed high certainty. Applications for acne, psoriasis, and eczema show enhanced patient compliance and efficacy. Despite clinical and regulatory obstacles, nano-CBD platforms provide a safe, focused, and efficient approach to improving dermatological care.",

      "abstract": "Cannabis and cannabinoid mixtures have been linked to a variety of health benefits including pain mitigation, suppression of nausea produced by chemotherapeutic agents, anti-inflammatory effects, and effects on energy homeostasis, glucose, and lipid metabolism. The latter properties have led to the suggestion that these products could have therapeutic effects on the development of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) - a severe type of liver pathology in obese and diabetic patients. However, varying agonist and antagonistic properties of different cannabinoids on the endogenous cannabinoid system make prediction regarding hepatic effects and diet interactions difficult. The current study was designed to examine hepatic pathology following chronic administration of a cannabinoid mixture (NEPE14) at a dose equivalent to one previously demonstrating antihyperalgesic effects in rats. The effects of NEPE14 were investigated in a mouse model of MASH produced by feeding a Western diet rich in fat and simple sugars. After 24 weeks of NEPE14 administration, there was no hepatotoxicity in mice receiving the control diet and no significant exacerbation of MASH in mice receiving the Western diet. In conclusion, no chronic liver toxicity was observed, but there was also no evidence for protection against MASH by this product.",

      "title": "Innovations in Cannabis Delivery Systems: A Patent Review (2012-2024).",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Cannabis sativa has been cultivated for over 11,700 years, originating in Central and Southeast Asia, and has been used for medical, recreational, and religious purposes. Among its therapeutic potentials, it is notable for its capacity to alleviate pain, nausea, anxiety, and more. The plant's primary secondary metabolites are cannabinoids, which interact with the endocannabinoid system to produce these effects. However, due to the dosage variability and the secondary effects associated with a lack of targeted action, their medical use is limited, creating the need for effective delivery systems. METHODOLOGY: This systematic patent review on cannabis drug delivery systems was conducted using patents retrieved from the Espacenet database. The search employed the keywords \"Cannabis\" and \"Delivery,\" along with the IPC classification code A61, to filter patents filed between 2012 and 2024. This initial search yielded 99 patents, which were further screened to identify 15 patents that met the inclusion criteria. RESULTS: Of the selected patents, most originated from the United States, followed by Canada, international patents (WIPO), and China. A notable increase in patent filings occurred in 2022, coinciding with the peak in scientific publications on the topic. This trend indicates a growing interest in the design of cannabis delivery systems. DISCUSSION: The historical importance and therapeutic potential of Cannabis sativa are welldocumented, yet modern medical use remains restricted due to pharmacokinetic limitations. Delivery systems such as extracellular vesicles, microneedles, and emulsions have been developed to improve the bioavailability and stability of cannabinoids. Extracellular vesicles facilitate targeted, noninvasive delivery of cannabinoids to the central nervous system. Microneedles offer a painless method for transdermal administration, overcoming skin barrier limitations. Emulsions improve the solubility and bioavailability of lipophilic cannabinoids, making them suitable for various administration routes. CONCLUSION: Since 2012, there has been considerable growth in patents and publications related to cannabis drug delivery systems, driven by the therapeutic potential of cannabinoids. Innovations in delivery systems like emulsions, microneedles, and extracellular vesicles aim to improve the pharmacokinetics and therapeutic efficacy of cannabis-derived compounds, representing a shift towards medical cannabis applications.",

      "abstract": "Cannabis sativa is a medicinally and economically significant plant known for its production of cannabinoids, terpenoids, and other secondary metabolites. This study presents a transcriptomic analysis to elucidate tissue-specific expression and regulatory mechanisms across leaves, stems, and roots. A total of 2,530 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, with key genes such as terpene synthase (TPS) and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) exhibiting elevated expression in leaf tissues, emphasizing their roles in terpenoid and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. Alternative splicing (AS) analysis revealed 8,729 distinct events, dominated by exon skipping, contributing to transcriptomic diversity. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) prediction identified 3,245 candidates, many of which displayed tissue-specific expression patterns and co-expression with metabolic genes, suggesting regulatory roles in secondary metabolism. Additionally, 12,314 SNPs and 2,786 INDELs were detected, with notable enrichment in genes associated with secondary metabolite biosynthesis, particularly in leaf tissues. These findings advance the understanding of molecular mechanisms governing secondary metabolism and genetic diversity in C. sativa, providing valuable insights for future metabolic engineering and breeding strategies to enhance cannabinoid production.",

      "abstract": "Cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive phytocannabinoid derived from Cannabis sativa, has emerged as a promising therapeutic agent due to its diverse pharmacological properties, including potent anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, and immunomodulatory effects. CBD modulates immune responses, including the regulation of T cell activity, induction of macrophage apoptosis, suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and modulation of signaling pathways involved in inflammation and immune homeostasis. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases to identify relevant preclinical and clinical studies on CBD's immunomodulatory effects. Preclinical and clinical studies demonstrate its efficacy in treating autoimmune diseases such as Type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease, along with its potential in neuropathic pain and cancer therapy. Recent advancements in nanotechnology-based delivery systems have further enhanced CBD's therapeutic potential by improving its solubility, bioavailability, and targeted delivery, enabling innovative approaches for wound healing, inflammation management, and cancer treatment. However, challenges such as variability in immune responses, limited long-term safety data, and potential drug-drug interactions persist. This review comprehensively examines CBD's pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and immunomodulatory mechanisms, highlighting its clinical potential, existing limitations, and future directions in advancing its integration into precision medicine and immune regulation.",

      "abstract": "Phytocannabinoids are natural products with highly promising pharmaceutical potential, mainly known from the plant Cannabis\u00a0sativa. However, their bioavailability is limited due to their high lipophilicity. Modification through glycosylation is known to improve the water solubility and stability of molecules. Enzymatic glycosylation requires specific enzymes with high catalytic activity in combination with efficient production systems. To date, only a few glycosyltransferases with activity toward cannabinoids have been described. In this study, we explore the substrate spectrum of the promiscuous UDP-glycosyltransferase CrUGT74AN3 from Catharanthus\u00a0roseus and demonstrate activity towards a broad range of cannabinoids and their biosynthetic intermediates. The highest activity was observed using cannabidiol (CBD) as an acceptor molecule. In addition, we show efficient biotransformation of CBD in an engineered Saccharomyces\u00a0cerevisiae strain. We investigate the influence of the hydrolytic activity of endogenous glucosidases and identify the UDP-glucose supply as a limiting factor in the yeast system. The co-expression of CrUGT74AN3 and a cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase from Bacillus\u00a0licheniformis in the engineered yeast strain led to the production of CBD-glycosides with up to six glucose moieties from CBD and cyclodextrin in\u00a0vivo. Finally, we confirm the applicability of the engineered yeast systems to other cannabinoids using cannabigerol and cannabinol.",

Consumption of CBD is increasing rapidly as it is federally legal and widely available in the United States, Europe, Mexico, Canada, and Asia. CBD is gaining traction in medical and biochemical research, though a comprehensive classification of CBD receptor interactions is yet to be elucidated. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search across PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar identified studies reporting cannabidiol (CBD) interactions with receptors, enzymes, and biological processes. Eligible articles included cell culture, animal model, biochemical, and clinical studies. Findings were thematically synthesized by body system, emphasizing mechanisms and implications for health and disease. RESULTS: Herein, I compile the literature to date of known interactions between CBD and various receptors, enzymes, and processes. I discuss the impact of CBD exposure on multiple processes, including endocannabinoid receptors, ion channels, cytochrome 450 enzymes, inflammatory pathways, and sex hormone regulation. I explain the potential effects of CBD on psychiatric disorders, seizure activity, nausea and vomiting, pain sensation, thermal regulation, neuronal signaling, neurodegenerative diseases, reproductive aging, drug metabolism, inflammation, sex hormone regulation, and energy homeostasis. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding how CBD functions and how it can interact with other recreational or pharmaceutical medications is necessary for proper clinical management of patients who consume CBD.",

METHODS: Twenty healthy adults with no past-month cannabis exposure completed five randomized outpatient sessions in a within-subjects, double-blind, crossover design. Participants inhaled \u03948-THC (10, 20, 40mg), \u03949-THC (20mg), or placebo (distilled water) using the Mighty Medic vaporizer. Measures included subjective drug effects, cognitive/psychomotor performance, puff topography, vital signs, and whole blood concentrations of \u03948-THC, \u03949-THC, and their metabolites. RESULTS: All \u03948-THC doses and \u03949-THC produced subjective drug effects that differed from placebo. 20mg \u03949-THC elicited stronger ratings of \"drug effect\" and \"unpleasant\" than 10mg \u03948-THC; no other subjective effects differed between \u03948-THC and \u03949-THC. 20mg \u03949-THC impaired DRUID performance compared with placebo; no other significant differences were observed between conditions on cognitive/psychomotor measures. Few pharmacodynamic differences were observed between \u03948-THC doses. Evidence of compensatory puffing emerged, with longer/larger puffs at lower \u03948-THC doses and placebo. Blood cannabinoid concentrations revealed that \u03948-THC metabolism differed from \u03949-THC, with less psychoactive 11-OH metabolite formed after \u03948-THC exposure. CONCLUSION: Various doses of vaporized \u03948-THC elicited comparable psychoactive effects as vaporized \u03949-THC, which is noteworthy considering \u03948-THC is less potent and generally perceived as less harmful/intoxicating than \u03949-THC. The magnitude of effects from cannabinoids is dictated by several factors including dose, route of administration, and, for inhaled methods, puffing behaviors. These data should be considered in future drug policy and public education initiatives.",

      "abstract": "This narrative review synthesizes the toxicological, clinical and medico-legal aspects of paediatric cannabis intoxication. By providing a comprehensive overview, it aims to inform future research, guide policymaking, and enhance clinical and toxicological practice in addressing this growing public health concern. The pharmacokinetics of cannabinoid ingestion in children are significantly influenced by the immaturity of their gastrointestinal tract and metabolic enzyme systems, resulting in altered oral bioavailability. Clinical data indicate that \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-related effects in paediatricpaediatric patients typically emerge within 2\u00a0hours of ingestion, with more severe symptoms developing within 4\u00a0hours. The endocannabinoid system (ECS) undergoes significant developmental changes, with marked differences in cannabinoid receptor expression and distribution across fetal, neonatal, and adult brains. During neurodevelopment, CB1 receptors exhibit unique expression patterns, including transient localization in brainstem regions critical for neurovegetative functions. These developmental dynamics likely explain children's heightened sensitivity to THC's neurological and neurovegetative effects, often resulting in more severe outcomes compared to adults. The reliable detection of cannabinoids involves integrating screening methods with confirmatory analytical techniques. Urine immunoassay testing is widely considered an helpful toolto assess a previous exposure, becoming positive within 3-4\u00a0h of ingestion. However, this method is prone to false positives. Plasma THC concentration, when measured close to the event, offers valuable insights into the quantity ingested and the correlation between exposure and clinical outcomes in the impairment window. Hair analysis, while useful for distinguishing between acute and chronic use, is susceptible to various biases. The rising incidence of acute cannabis intoxication in children underscores the urgent need for targeted public health interventions and stricter regulatory frameworks. Preventive measures such as child-resistant packaging, public education campaigns, and cannabis use screening during pregnancy are essential to mitigate risks. Clinicians should consider THC exposure in the differential diagnosis of children presenting with unexplained neurological, immune, or metabolic symptoms.",

      "title": "Malnutrition in Substance Use Disorders: A Critical Issue in Their Treatment and Recovery.",
      "abstract": "Substance use disorders (SUDs) are widely prevalent in many countries, with the highest rates observed in nicotine and alcohol use, followed by opioid and cannabis use disorders. Within the field of SUDs, nutrition has become an increasingly important area of focus in both epidemiology and public health, as malnutrition is frequently observed among individuals affected by these disorders. Research indicates that people with SUDs are more likely to experience malnutrition than the general population; however, this issue remains an often-overlooked consequence that can impact disease progression and recovery outcomes. SUDs disrupt brain metabolism, leading to changes in brain function and disturbances in glucose, protein, and lipid metabolism. Evidence shows that individuals with certain SUDs often suffer from poor nutritional status, marked by high sugar consumption and insufficient intake of key micronutrients like iron, as well as vitamins D, C, A, and B-likely due to prioritizing drug use over adequate food intake. Importantly, diet can alter the metabolism and effects of drugs, potentially amplifying or diminishing their impact. While nutrition should play a central role in SUD treatment and rehabilitation, current research-both in animal models and human studies-on the role and benefits of specific nutrients in this context remains limited. This literature review aims to synthesize the available findings on the impact of malnutrition in human and murine models of SUDs, with the goal of identifying which nutrients may provide the most support for treatment and recovery.",

      "abstract": "Neuropathic pain, a complex and often devastating condition, poses significant challenges for its effective management. Despite promising research on various cannabis formulations and delivery methods for neuropathic pain, significant gaps remain in our knowledge. While inhaled cannabis shows analgesic effects and alternative delivery methods may improve bioavailability, oral formulations have yielded mixed results, often limited by small sample sizes and placebo effects. Therefore, further research is essential to optimize cannabis formulations, identify responder profiles to tailor treatments effectively, and, most critically, confirm the long-term safety and efficacy of cannabis-based therapies in managing NP. This review article aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the therapeutic potential of cannabis-based medicines, with a particular focus on cannabinoids. This review, though not systematic, examines 11 clinical studies, specifically Randomised Clinical Trials) published from 2014 to 2024, highlighting the efficacy of numerous cannabis formulations, in alleviating neuropathic pain. Key findings show that cannabinoids can reduce pain perception, improve patient quality of life, and mitigate other symptoms associated with neuropathic pain. The synergistic effects of tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol are discussed, emphasizing their ability to enhance analgesic effects, while potentially reducing the psychoactive side effects of tetrahydrocannabinol. This review emphasizes the importance of the personalized approach to improve therapeutic outcomes. Limitations of the existing research focusing on cannabis for neuropathic pain are limited by heterogeneity, lack of standardization, small sample sizes, and reliance on subjective outcomes, impacting the reliability and generalizability of findings. However, this exhaustive review aims to inform clinicians and researchers about the evolving role of cannabis in contemporary pain management strategies, illustrating the diverse pharmacological profiles of cannabinoids and their potential as adjunct therapies for neuropathic pain management.",

      "abstract": "AIMS: The study aimed to explore the sustainable synthesis of metal nanoparticles using a green and eco-friendly resource. Specifically, it investigated the utilization of Cannabis sativa waste extract for the production of gold and silver nanoparticles, focusing on their antimicrobial activity against gram-negative bacteria, particularly Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, which are significant in nosocomial infections. METHODS: Cannabis sativa waste extract was employed to synthesize gold and silver nanoparticles through a green synthesis approach. The produced nanoparticles were characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The antimicrobial efficacy of the synthesized nanoparticles was assessed through their minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), and minimal biofilm inhibitory concentration (MBIC) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, utilizing a microcultivation device, solid medium cultivation, and a metabolic activity assay in a polystyrene microtiter plate, respectively. RESULTS: The TEM analysis revealed the size and morphology of the nanoparticles, while AAS confirmed their concentration. XRD provided insights into the crystalline structure, and FTIR analysis identified the molecular structure of the nanoparticle's stabilizing layer. The synthesized nanoparticles showed significant antimicrobial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with determined MIC, MBC, and MBIC values of produced silver nanoparticles, showcasing their potential as effective antimicrobial agents. CONCLUSIONS: This study successfully demonstrated the synthesis of silver and gold nanoparticles using Cannabis sativa waste extract and highlighted their potent antimicrobial properties. It underscores the potential of utilizing plant waste extracts in sustainable nanomaterial synthesis and contributes to the fields of green nanotechnology and waste valorization within the circular economy. The findings also offer valuable insights into developing natural waste source-based antimicrobial agents.",

      "abstract": "Neuroinflammation is a hallmark of various neurodegenerative disorders, yet effective treatments remain limited. This study investigates the neuroprotective potential of a cannabidiol (CBD)-Rich Cannabis sativa L. (CS) extract in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation mouse model. The effects on anxiety-like behavior, cognitive function, and locomotor activity were assessed using behavioral tests (open field, elevated plus maze, novel object recognition, and Morris water maze). Antioxidant activity was measured by assaying glutathione (GSH) levels and lipid peroxidation by-products (TBARs). Anti-inflammatory properties were evaluated using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (QRt-PCR) for proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) mRNAs in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Astrocytic bioenergetics were analyzed using extracellular flux assays. Additionally, computational inference with a deep learning approach was conducted to evaluate the synergistic interactions among CS phytocompounds on the CB1 receptors. Compared with synthetic CBD, the CS extract (20.0\u2009mg/kg) demonstrated superior efficacy in mitigating LPS-induced anxiety-like behavior, cognitive deficits, and locomotor impairments. It also significantly mitigated oxidative stress (increased GSH, reduced TBARs) and suppressed proinflammatory cytokines and GFAP mRNAs, indicating potent anti-inflammatory properties. The extract modulated CB1 receptor expression and preserved metabolic homeostasis in cortical astrocytes, preventing their shift from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation under neuroinflammatory conditions. Computational modeling highlighted conformational changes in CB1 receptor residues induced by Delta-9-THC that enhanced CBD binding. These findings underscore the potential of CS extract as a therapeutic candidate for managing neuroinflammation and its associated neurodegenerative consequences, warranting further clinical exploration.",

      "abstract": "Cannabis use has increased significantly in the last decade. This article presents a case where a patient needed more local anesthetic (LA) than usual to induce effective anesthesia during hair transplant surgery. The reason cannabis users often need more LA is poorly understood. One possibility is that cannabis withdrawal effect makes patients more sensitive to pain and stress. Additionally, vasodilatory property of cannabis may speed up LA clearance from the application site. The interactions of two major cannabinoids, cannabidiol (CBD) and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), with cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1), cannabinoid receptor type 2 (CB2), and transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) receptors are also complex. Furthermore, CBD and THC function as cytochrome P450 enzyme inhibitors potentially impacting systemic metabolism. When planning to administer LA during hair restoration surgery in cannabis users, clinicians should obtain a detailed history of prior consumption (type of cannabis, frequency, dosage). Preoperative planning should consider the anticipated duration of surgery and calculate the maximum safe LA dose to avoid the risk of toxicity. Also, patients should be carefully monitored for vital signs during surgery. If a patient requires frequent re-injection to remain pain free, the surgeon may need to re-assess the surgical plan to avoid toxicity.",

In this review, potential nano-formulated natural drugs from plants such as Ginseng, Pistacia lentiscus, Amaranthus hypochondriacus, and Cannabis sativa in the treatment of melanoma are discussed. We discuss various characteristics of nanoformulations, including liposomes and nanoemulsions, with respect to their ability in enhancing drug delivery and bioavailability. Key mechanisms of action including reactive oxygen species modulation, apoptotic signaling induction, immune modulation through TLR4/MyD88, and inhibition of angiogenesis by VEGF pathways are discussed. Although these natural nanoformulations show promise in improving therapeutic outcomes, challenges related to their clinical application and safety persist. Further research is warranted to fully explore how this novel approach can best be utilized against melanoma.",

Present evaluations of THC-induced impairment in legal settings rely on biological drug tests that solely establish cannabis use, rather than cannabis impairment. The current study evaluated the metabolome in blood collected from occasional and chronic cannabis users (N\u2009=\u200935) at baseline and following treatments with cannabis (300\u2009\u03bcg/kg THC) and placebo, with the aim to identify unique metabolic alterations that are associated with acute cannabis intoxication and cannabis use frequency. Blood samples were collected at baseline and repeatedly during 70\u2009min after treatment. Sustained attention performance and ratings of subjective high were taken twice within 40\u2009min after treatment. Metabolomic fingerprints of occasional and chronic cannabis users were distinctly different at baseline, when both groups were not intoxicated. A total of 14 metabolites, mainly related to endocannabinoid and amino acid metabolism, were identified that distinguished chronic from occasional cannabis users and that yielded a discriminant analysis model with an 80% classification rate (95% CI: 61-91%). Distinct metabolomic fingerprints were found for occasional cannabis users who, in contrast to chronic cannabis users, showed attentional impairment and elevated ratings of subjective high during cannabis intoxication. These included increments in organic acids, \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate and second messenger ceramides. The current study demonstrates the feasibility of the metabolomics approach to identify metabolic changes that are specific to the neurocognitive state of cannabis intoxication and to the history of cannabis use.",

This work reports the preparation and characterization of a certified reference material (CRM) for toxic elements-arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), and lead (Pb)-in pulverized, lyophilized cannabis leaf tissue. To prepare the CRM INM-040-1, a portion of dried ground cannabis vegetal material was spiked with the elements at mass fraction values close to the levels of interest in relevant regulations for this kind of matrix: 0.34 mg/kg for arsenic, 0.34 mg/kg for cadmium, and 0.66 mg/kg for lead. The elements were quantified by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) in combination with graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy (GF-AAS, for cadmium and lead) or hydride generation atomic absorption spectroscopy (HG-AAS, for arsenic). The analytical calibration was done by gravimetric standard addition for ICP-MS and GF-AAS, while bracketing calibration was used for HG-AAS. Furthermore, internal standard correction was used during ICP-MS measurements. The analytical methods were validated to demonstrate their fitness for purpose. The preparation variables of the CRM (particle size, drying treatment, and spiking conditions) were studied to improve the homogeneity of the CRM. The mass fraction of the toxic elements was certified with relative standard uncertainties ranging from 4.2 to 6.9%. The uncertainty contributions considered were the elements' mass fraction measurements, the between-methods bias, the (in)homogeneity of the production batch, and the (in)stability under transport and storage conditions. This new CRM constitutes a useful tool for the laboratories assessing the harmlessness of cannabis materials, promoting humans' safety and regulatory compliance within the medicinal cannabis industry.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline and behavior impairments. Despite recent approvals of anti-amyloid antibodies, there remains a need for disease modifying and easily accessible therapies. Emerging evidence suggests that targeting the endocannabinoid system may hold promise for AD therapy as it plays a crucial role in different physiological processes, including learning, memory and anxiety, as well as inflammatory and immune responses. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of the synthetic cannabinoid WIN 55,212-2 on memory deficits in Tg4-42 transgenic mice. METHODS: Tg4-42 mice were assigned to two treatment groups to investigate the preventive effects of WIN 55,212-2 after a prolonged washout period, as well as the therapeutic effects of WIN 55,212-2 on behavior. Furthermore, the effects of WIN 55,212-2 treatment on AD pathology, including inflammation, amyloid-\u03b2 load, neurogenesis, and brain glucose metabolism, were evaluated. RESULTS: Therapeutic WIN 55,212-2 treatment rescued recognition memory and spatial reference deficits in Tg4-42 mice. Furthermore, therapeutic WIN 55,212-2 administration improved motor performance. In addition, preventative WIN 55,212-2 treatment rescued spatial learning and reference memory deficits. Importantly, WIN 55,212-2 treatment did not affect anxiety-like behavior. However, therapeutic and preventative WIN 55,212-2 treatment resulted in an increase locomotor activity and swimming speed in Tg4-42 mice. WIN-treatment reduced microgliosis in the hippocampus of preventively treated mice and rescued brain glucose metabolism in therapeutically treated Tg4-42 mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings emphasize the therapeutic promise of the synthetic cannabinoid WIN 55,212-2 in alleviating behavioral and cognitive deficits linked to AD.",

      "abstract": "Cannabidiol (CBD), a major component of extract from the plant Cannabis sativa L., has demonstrated efficacy in treating childhood-onset epilepsy; however, animal studies and clinical trials have reported elevated liver enzymes after CBD use, suggesting potential liver toxicity. In a previous study, we demonstrated that CBD caused cytotoxicity with apoptosis and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in human hepatic cells. In the present study, we investigated the toxicity profile of the two main metabolites of CBD, 7-hydroxy-CBD and 7-carboxy-CBD, in primary human hepatocytes and HepG2 cells. Our findings indicated that both metabolites induced cellular damage similar to the parent drug in these cells. 7-Hydroxy-CBD and 7-carboxy-CBD also caused cell cycle disturbances, apoptosis, and ER stress in HepG2 cells. Additionally, we explored the role of cytochrome P450 (CYP) in the metabolism of 7-hydroxy-CBD and 7-carboxy-CBD using HepG2 cell lines expressing 14 individual CYPs. We determined that 7-hydroxy-CBD is metabolized by CYP2D6, and CYP2D6-mediated metabolism attenuated the cytotoxicity, apoptosis, and ER stress induced by 7-hydroxy-CBD. The CYPs did not metabolize 7-carboxy-CBD. In summary, our findings highlight the mechanisms underlying cytotoxicity induced by 7-hydroxy-CBD and 7-carboxy-CBD in hepatic cells.",

      "abstract": "This research focused on developing a hemp protein concentrate through a potential sustainable method, with nutritional and industrial value for the emerging alternative protein industry. By response surface methodology, the optimal processing conditions (100% ethanol, 50\u00b0C, and 10% w/v solid-to-solvents ratio) resulted in a hemp protein concentrate with 68.61%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.71% protein. The process had a protein yield value of 94.11%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.45%, which aligns with current sustainable food processing trends and is an excellent value compared to traditional methods for hemp seeds. The concentrate met nutritional quality criteria for most examined parameters and showed positive results regarding essential amino acids absorption through in vitro digestion compared to nonessential amino acids. Furthermore, its techno-functional properties, particularly oil-holding capacity, emulsification properties, and gelling qualities achieved commercial standards. This research validates the potential for producing new protein concentrates from dehulled hemp seeds through an innovative green chemistry-based method. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The research presents a method based on green chemistry for the obtention of hemp protein concentrate from hemp seeds. Hemp seeds are not considered a \"novel food\" according to the European Commission. Hemp protein concentrate had 95% protein yield and similar or better functional properties compared to commercial proteins. Thus, hemp protein is an important product for food industry applications.",

      "abstract": "Cannabidiol (CBD), the primary non-psychoactive cannabinoid isolated from cannabis, exhibits promising antibacterial effects. However, the antibacterial mechanism of CBD remains poorly understood. In this study, the mechanism was investigated using bacterial inhibition assays, label-free proteomics, and untargeted metabolomics, with Bacillus licheniformis (B. licheniformis), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), and Enterococcus faecium (E. faecium) selected as representative Gram-positive bacteria. The results revealed that CBD caused significant damage to bacterial cell walls and membranes, leading to notable changes in proteomic and metabolic profiles. Specifically, 437, 120, and 195 proteins, as well as 52, 153, and 94 metabolites, were differentially expressed in B. licheniformis, S. aureus, and E. faecium, respectively. The antimicrobial mechanism of CBD shares similarities with previously known antibacterial agents, such as penicillin and cephalosporins, particularly in affecting the bacterial cell wall, but differs in its detailed mode of action. CBD disrupted the biosynthesis of primary and secondary metabolites and altered bacterial metabolism, contributing to its antibacterial activity. This study provides valuable insights into the antibacterial mechanism of CBD, supporting its potential development as an antibiotic alternative and its application in food safety. SIGNIFICANCE: It is crucial to find alternatives to antibiotics to mitigate the impact of pathogenic bacteria on food safety and reduce the use of antibiotics. CBD is the primary non-psychoactive cannabinoid derived from cannabis, and it has shown promising antibacterial effects. However, the antimicrobial mechanisms of CBD have not been well elucidated. This study provides a deep understanding of the antibacterial mechanism from the cellular to molecular level, which will contribute to the development of CBD as a novel antibacterial agent.",

Evidence suggests that CBD promotes muscle injury recovery in athletes, but whether and how CBD improves endurance performance remains unclear. Here we investigated the effects of CBD treatment on exercise performance in mice and assessed whether this effect involves the gut microbiome. CBD administration significantly increased treadmill running performance in mice, accompanied by an increase in oxidative myofiber composition. CBD also increased mitochondrial biogenesis and the expression of associated genes such as PGC-1\u03b1, phosphorylated CREB and AMPK in muscle tissue. Interestingly, CBD altered the composition of the gut microbiome, and antibiotic treatment reduced the muscle endurance-enhancing effects of CBD and mitochondrial biogenesis. We isolated Bifidobacterium animalis, a microbe increased by CBD administration, and named it KBP-1. Treatment with B. animalis KBP-1 in mice resulted in improved running performance. Whole-genome analysis revealed that B. animalis KBP-1 presented high expression of genes involved in branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis, expression of branched-chain amino acid release pumps and metabolism of lactic acid. In summary, our study identified CBD and B. animalis KBP-1 as potential endurance exercise-promoting agents.",

      "title": "The Presence of the Endocannabinoid System in an In Vitro Model of Gorham-Stout Disease and Its Possible Role in the Pathogenesis.",
      "abstract": "Gorham-Stout syndrome (GSD), also known as disappearing bone disease, is an extremely rare bone disorder, characterized by a huge bone loss, which is followed by a lack of new matrix deposition and an excessive proliferation of both blood vessels and lymphatics. Unfortunately, the biological causes of GSD are still unknown. Recent studies that have tried to understand the etiopathogenesis of GSD have been principally focused on the vascular and osteoclastogenic aspects, not considering the possibility of a lack of osteoblast function. Nowadays, a diagnosis is still difficult, and is often made by exclusion of the presence of other pathologies, as well as on radiological evidence, and finally confirmed by histological examination. Treatment also remains a critical issue for clinicians today, who mostly try to control the progression of the disease. Over the last two decades, clear evidence has emerged that the endocannabinoid system plays an important role in bone metabolism, leading scientists to hypothesize that it could be involved in physiological and pathological bone processes. In this work, we analyzed the presence of the ES in a primary cell line of human mesenchymal stem cells derived from a GSD patient for the first time, to understand if and how this complex network may play a role in the pathogenesis of the syndrome. Our preliminary results demonstrated that the ES is also present in the pathological tissue. Moreover, the qRT-PCR analysis showed an altered expression of the different ES components (i.e., CNR1, CNR2, TRPV1, and GPR55). We observed an upregulation of CNR1 and TRPV1 expression, while the opposite trend was noticed for CNR2 and GPR55 expression. Thus, these results could lead us to speculate that possible deregulation of the ES may play an important role in the lack of bone regeneration in GSD patients. However, further studies will be necessary to confirm the role of the ES in the progression of GSD and understand whether the natural components of Cannabis Sativa could play a therapeutic role in the treatment of the disease.",

      "abstract": "Cannabidiol (CBD), one of the main actives from Cannabis sativa has been perpetually explored lately for its therapeutic effects. Its main attributes, such as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, snowball into pain management, epilepsy and seizure alleviation, anxiety relief, as well as numerous other implications through the entire metabolism. However, conventional administration routes challenge its therapeutic potential, with reported poor water solubility, hepatic degradation, gastric instability and erratic bioavailability observed in oral administration. As a result, the transdermal delivery systems have emerged as a promising alternative to oral or inhaled routes, offering improved bioavailability and targeted effects. The medical use of CBD throughout Europe, UK, USA or Australia is extensive and usually represented by pharmaceutical preparations recommended after conventional treatment routs fail. The non-medical use is limited by each country's own legislation, a wider range of products being available, but the irregular regulatory landscape coupled with the growing market of cannabinoid-infused products, emphasizes the need for standardized formulations and further clinical research. The present work critically examines the transdermal administration of cannabidiol, explores the skin's potential as a route and the strategies involved in using it for systemic targeting. We highlighted key challenges and provided insights into CBD`s variable bioavailability based on different administration routes and methods, thus compiling a literature-based absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) study. We also explore the role of the endocannabinoid system, its function in various medical conditions, and the therapeutic effects associated with CBD, particularly in light of the varying legislation across countries. While the breadth of potential benefits is compelling, it is essential to emphasize the ongoing nature of CBD research as individual responses to it can vary significantly.",

      "abstract": "The majority of patients with cannabis use disorder (CUD) regularly take medication. Cannabinoids influence metabolism of some commonly prescribed drugs. However, little is known about the characteristics and frequency of potential cannabis-drug (CDIs) and drug-drug interactions (DDIs) in patients with CUD. Therefore, our study aimed to determine the prevalence and characteristics of drug interactions in patients with CUD during inpatient treatment on an addiction-specific ward over a six-year-period. To this aim, medication charts were analyzed and screened for potential CDIs and DDIs. Herein, the drugs.com classification for potential CDIs and UpToDate Lexicomp program for potential DDIs were utilized. The study cohort consisted of 301 patient cases, predominantly male (85.0%), with a median age of 37 years. 89.4% (269/301) of all cases involved were taking at least one drug that could potentially interact with cannabis. Levomethadone, buprenorphine and morphine were the most common drugs involved in potentially serious CDIs. In addition, 196 DDIs were identified, of which 25.5% were classified as 'avoid combination' and 74.5% as 'consider therapy modification'. Hereby, combinations of levomethadone with other psychotropic drugs most frequently accounted for potentially severe and mild DDIs. The results of our study indicate that especially patients diagnosed with CUD also receiving opioid substitution therapy are at risk for potential drug interactions. Therefore, a clinical monitoring of vigilance and respiratory function should be applied during inpatient treatment. Routine use of interaction check tools in patients diagnosed with CUD should also be considered by healthcare providers. In addition, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) should be used to increase medication safety in this patient population.",

      "abstract": "Policy fragmentation contributes to the myriad environmental impacts of the cannabis industry and impedes solutions. Examination of how this plays out in the context of the US provides real-world examples, further complicated by the lack of a robust overarching federal policy framework. A key determinant of environmental problems is whether cannabis cultivation is conducted indoors (greenhouses or windowless plant factories) or outdoors in open fields. For example, emissions of greenhouse gases are \u223c100-times greater for indoor cultivation, and water use is higher when accounting for water associated with power production. Other distinct spheres of impact involve land use, waste production, air pollution, ecosystem degradation, and adverse indoor environmental quality conditions faced by workers. Some consequences are differentially burdensome for marginalized populations, suggesting an overlay of environmental justice considerations. Relevant but uncoordinated regulatory entities include those focused formally on cannabis regulation, law enforcement, energy supply and demand, building codes, air quality, climate change, water supply and quality, waste management, fish and wildlife, occupational safety, public health, and urban planning. While criminalization has contributed to environmental concerns, both legal and illicit operations are problematic. Cannabis legalization enables improved policy coordination, but is not a panacea or intrinsic solution. The potential for policymaker collaboration and regulatory coordination includes removing barriers to improved practices and, in particular, providing incentives for lower-impact outdoor cultivation. However, politics often stands as an impediment to otherwise pragmatic policy solutions.",

      "title": "Effects of five cannabis oils with different CBD: THC ratios and terpenes on hypertension, dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis, oxidative stress, and CB1 receptor in an experimental model.",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common liver disorder caused by oxidative stress and dysregulation of lipid metabolism. The endocannabinoid system (ECS), particularly the type 1 cannabinoid (CB1) receptor, plays a crucial role in NAFLD progression. Cannabinoids, such as cannabidiol (CBD) and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), along with terpenes, such as beta-myrcene and d-limonene, have shown potential therapeutic effects on liver health, particularly in reducing oxidative stress and modulating lipid metabolism. This study aimed to analyse the effects of five cannabis oils (COs), each with different CBD:THC ratios and terpenes content, on hypertension, dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis, oxidative stress, and CB1 receptor expression in an experimental model of NAFLD induced by a sucrose-rich diet (SRD) in Wistar rats for 3 weeks. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were fed either a: (1) reference diet (RD; standard commercial laboratory diet) or a: (2) sucrose-rich diet (SRD) for 3 weeks. 3 to 7 SRD\u2009+\u2009CO as following: (3) SRD\u2009+\u2009THC; (4) SRD\u2009+\u2009CBD; (5) SRD\u2009+\u2009CBD:THC 1:1; (6) SRD\u2009+\u2009CBD:THC 2:1; and (7) SRD\u2009+\u2009CBD:THC 3:1. The COs were administered orally at a dose of 1.5\u00a0mg total cannabinoids/kg body weight daily. The cannabinoid and terpenes content of all COs used in the study was determined. The terpenes found in COs were beta-myrcene, d-limonene, terpinolene, linalool, beta-caryophyllene, alpha-humulene, (-)-guaiol, (-)-alpha-bisabolol. During the experimental period, body weight, food intake and blood pressure were measured. Serum glucose, triglyceride, total cholesterol, uric acid, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (AP) levels were evaluated. Liver tissue histology, NAFLD activity score (NAS), triglyceride and cholesterol content, lipogenic enzyme activities, enzyme related to mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, reactive oxygen species (ROS), thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS), and antioxidant enzyme activities were also evaluated. The CB1 receptor expression was also determined. RESULTS: The results showed that SRD-fed rats developed hypertension, dyslipidemia, liver damage, hepatic steatosis, lipid peroxidation, and oxidative stress. This was accompanied by upregulation of liver CB1 receptor expression. CBD-rich CO, CBD:THC 1:1 ratio CO; CBD:THC 2:1 ratio CO and CBD:THC 3:1 ratio CO showed antihypertensive properties. THC-rich CO, CBD:THC 1:1 ratio CO; CBD:THC 2:1 ratio CO showed the greatest beneficial effects against hepatic steatosis and liver damage. All COs exhibited antioxidant effects in liver tissue. This was associated with normal liver CB1 receptor expression. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that COs, particularly THC-rich CO, CBD:THC ratio 1:1 CO, CBD:THC ratio 2:1 CO and terpenes, can effectively reduce dyslipidemia, liver damage and hepatic steatosis in SRD-induced NAFLD. COs with a higher proportion of CBD in their composition showed antihypertensive properties. All the COs exhibited antioxidant properties. These findings suggest that COs, especially those with CBD:THC ratios of 1:1 and 2:1 and terpenes, may represent a promising therapeutic approach for managing NAFLD and preventing its progression to more severe liver disease.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: In 2016, California legalized cannabis for adult recreational use; after recreational sales began in 2018, it became the largest retail market worldwide. This study profiled specific risks and prevention opportunities across age groups and examined changes in medically significant child cannabis exposures before and after legalization. METHODS: Researchers conducted analyses, including interrupted time-series, to examine 1695 California Poison Control System (CPCS) reports of cannabis exposure in children 0-17 years of age, from 2010-2020. Analyses were confined to moderate and severe exposures, identified by CPCS toxicologists as requiring medical attention. RESULTS: Monthly rates of moderate/severe cannabis exposure per million children increased following legalization (\u03b2=0.06, CI [0.05, 0.08]), especially in children under 5. Fourteen percent required critical care admission. Exposures were primarily unintentional in younger children (87.7-99.2%) and intentional in adolescents (85.5%). Across all ages, most exposures occurred in the home (94.0%) and involved edible products (83.5%). An analysis of packaging on edible brands frequently cited in health records found that most could be easily mistaken for popular candies and snack foods. CONCLUSIONS: Following cannabis legalization in California, reports of child cannabis exposures requiring medical attention increased significantly. Most reported cannabis exposures occurred in the home through the ingestion of edible products, often packaged to look like popular candy and snack food brands. To prevent these harms, cannabis legalization should be accompanied by robust marketing and packaging regulations (e.g., plain labels, larger warning labels). Secondary prevention should focus on educating parents and caregivers on safe cannabis storage in the home.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This review article addresses the vaping chemistry of manufactured cannabis concentrates-a topic that remains under-researched despite the widespread availability and growing popularity of these products. Given their current prevalence and the fact that many of the findings discussed herein are from early-stage investigations, further research is essential to fully assess the public health risks associated with concentrate use. The purpose of this article is to help begin to bridge this knowledge gap by outlining the technical challenges of studying cannabis concentrates and to present evidence-based data concerning toxicant exposures as a foundation for future investigations. METHODS: A search of cannabis concentrate vaping within the date range of 2019-2025 on Google Scholar returned approximately 2,700 hits. A cannabis concentrate was defined as a sample containing at least 50% (w/w) cannabinoids. In addition to our group's articles, the search results contained six manuscripts that described at least a partial focus on molecular emissions specifically derived from vaping or dabbing samples that included cannabis concentrates. FINDINGS: Studying cannabis concentrate vaping poses distinct technical challenges that differ from those associated with electronic nicotine delivery systems. Emissions from vaping concentrates contain a substantial proportion of harmful aerosol toxicants, including isoprene, 3-methylcrotonaldehyde, 3-methyl-1-butene, and 2-methyl-2-butene. Moreover, some concentrate formulations have contained hazardous additives such as pine rosin and ketene precursors such as cannabinoid acetates. As with nicotine vaping, the presence of oxygen plays a critical role in driving the formation of many toxic chemical degradation products during vaping. CONCLUSION: Since the legalization of recreational cannabis, concentrates have become one of the most rapidly expanding segments of the U.S. cannabis market. However, research into the specific health risks of vaping these products has significantly lagged their widespread use. The studies presented in this review article highlight the potential for exposure to known toxicants during the vaping of cannabis concentrates.",

METHODS: The study was conducted to examine the influence of screw press extraction temperatures (30, 60, 80, 100, 120 and 140\u00a0\u00b0C) on hemp oil yield and quality. Extracted oils were analyzed according to key parameters, including oil yield, total phenolic content, tocopherols, oxidation stability index (OSI), pigments, quality indices (free fatty acids (FFA), peroxide value (PV), conjugated diene (K232) and conjugated triene (K270)), fatty acid profiles and color parameters (L*, a*, b*, C* RESULTS: The temperature played a key role in yield, reaching a maximum of 21.82%, representing an oil recovery of 66.68% at 100\u00a0\u00b0C, an improvement of approximately 4% over cold pressing (30\u00a0\u00b0C). Increasing the extraction temperature from 30\u00a0\u00b0C to 140\u00a0\u00b0C resulted in an increase in tocopherol content from 410.84\u00a0mg/kg to 512.98\u00a0mg/kg. On the other hand, temperature had no significant effect on the TPC, which varied from 31.76\u00a0mg GAE/kg to 41.89\u00a0mg GAE/kg as confirmed by HPLC-DAD/ESI-MS\u00b2 analysis. On the other hand, oils extracted at higher temperatures were lower in quality, with higher PV, ranging from 6.36 meq O CONCLUSION: Extraction temperature has a significant influence on the yield and quality of hemp oil. Underline the importance of selecting the optimum extraction temperature to balance yield and quality.",

      "abstract": "Iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) have emerged as the most widely synthesized metal nanoparticles in sustainable chemistry due to their unique magnetic properties, excellent biocompatibility, biodegradability, and non-toxicity. In this study, IONPs are successfully synthesized via a rapid, sustainable, and environmentally friendly green synthesis approach using Cannabis sativa L. leaf extract. X-ray diffraction analysis determined that the synthesized NPs had an average particle size of 18.8\u2009nm, while transmission electron microscopy images reveal a spherical morphology with sizes ranging from 12 to 21\u2009nm. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy analysis confirmed the presence of cannabinoids, terpenoids, and flavonoids, which are believed to play a crucial role in the formation and stabilization of IONPs. Its photocatalytic potential is demonstrated through the degradation of bromophenol blue dye. Additionally, the NPs exhibited significant antibacterial and antifungal activity against various microbial species, along with promising anticancer effects on cancer cell lines. In conclusion, this study provides a promising foundation for advancing the large-scale, commercial production of IONPs through green synthesis methods. By offering an eco-friendly and efficient alternative to conventional nanoparticle synthesis, the findings contribute significantly to the growing body of research in sustainable nanotechnology.",

The fungal endophytes Metarhizium robertsii and Pochonia chlamydosporia were previously shown to improve hemp growth. Here, the impact of three fungal endophytes, M. robertsii, P. chlamydosporia as well as Trichoderma harzianum on hemp was investigated under treatment with 300\u2009mM NaCl as a salinity stress and reduced watering volume as a drought stress. Plant growth parameters, a lipid oxidation indicator, leaf porphyrins together with the abiotic stress responses genes were assessed in hemp with or without fungal colonization under normal and stressed conditions. Under salinity stress, the growth of hemp was ameliorated by the application of Metarhizium, Pochonia, or Trichoderma in the soil. The increased production of malondialdehyde (MDA) and the reduction in porphyrins in hemp under salinity stress were restored in the presence of fungal endophytes. Under drought stress, the aboveground growth of hemp was recovered by the application of Metarhizium together with the reduced production of porphyrins. The stress related gene CsNAC3 showed decreased expression during fungal application compared with uninoculated hemp under salinity or drought treatment. Colonization of Metarhizium, Pochonia or Trichoderma improved salt stress tolerance in hemp and this was accompanied by a reduction in oxidative stress.",

      "title": "A new Clonostachys Sp. ZBS49 filamentous fungus with high production of betulinic acid and its inhibitory effect on liver cancer cells.",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Triterpenoid compounds such as betulinic acid (BA) and oleanolic acid (OA) exhibit considerable pharmacological activities. However, their current production primarily relies on plant extraction and chemical synthesis, methods that are often plagued by low efficiency, complex extraction processes, and environmental concerns. Microbial-based synthesis has emerged as one of the most effective approaches for producing BA and OA. RESULTS: This study presented the first identification of filamentous fungal strains efficiently synthesizing both BA and OA. The strain ZBS49 is a newly identified species of Clonostachys isolated from Gleditsia japonica Miq. (showing 99.82% sequence identity), produced 47.7\u00a0mg/L of BA. The strain XJ1-1, characterized as Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and isolated from Cannabis sativa L., yielded 65.76\u00a0mg/L of OA. After optimizing the culture medium and cultivation conditions, the yields of ZBS49 and XJ1-1 increased to 288.97 and 86.14\u00a0mg/L, representing improvements of 506% and 31%, respectively. Furthermore, we discovered that the BA extract of the ZBS49 strain significantly inhibited hepatocellular cancer cells (SMMC-7721 and HepG2) in a dose-dependent manner, with a minimum inhibitory concentration of 70 \u00b5M. Genomic analysis of Clonostachys sp. ZBS49 elucidated that the presence of 16 putative genes was related to triterpenoid biosynthesis and 6 distinct terpene biosynthetic gene clusters. Among the 145 CYP450, 5 genes involved in C-28 oxidation were predicted. CONCLUSIONS: This research underscores the effectiveness of filamentous fungi as a biotechnological platform for the efficient production of BA and its derivatives, highlighting their potential applications in cancer therapy. Furthermore, these findings provide valuable genetic resources and establish a robust technical and theoretical framework for utilizing ZBS49 as a microbial platform for the biosynthesis of triterpenoids.",

The gel was prepared in three variations with different hemp seed concentrations. We then analyzed the gel for pH and macronutrient composition. The sensory characteristics were analyzed for seven parameters, including appearance, taste, color, texture, aroma, consistency, and acceptability, using a hedonic scale on 25 panelists. A sensory analysis showed that sample A received an overall acceptability score of 7.16 \u00b1 0.99 from the sensory panel. The shelf life was observed at the recommended temperature of 4 degrees Celsius, which was 12 days. The best formulation was sample B with 38 g of hemp seeds, which showed better taste, color, aroma, and acceptability and a lower average pH value (6.68 \u00b1 1.44, 6.56 \u00b1 1.29, 7.6 \u00b1 1.16, 7 \u00b1 1.26, and 5.822 \u00b1 0.0183, respectively). Sample B contained 30.8 g of protein, 16.09 g of carbohydrates, 8.4 g of fat, and 263.16 kcal of energy per 100 g. The resulting ratio of carbohydrates to protein is optimal for use as a high-protein post-workout meal. Hence, it can be considered a post-workout supplement.",

The aim of this investigation was to compare the results of preliminary screening for drugs in oral fluid samples collected from suspected drug-impaired drivers using DrugWipe 6S and WipeAlyser reader with the results obtained from blood samples. Additionally, we compared the DrugWipe test results with findings of drug traces detected within the used DrugWipe devices. Police officers selected a sample of 355 suspected drug-impaired drivers in 2023. They used DrugWipe 6S for preliminary drug screening of drivers. After the field drug testing of oral fluid, the apprehended drivers were brought to a physician for the collection of blood samples. The collected samples (DrugWipe devices and blood samples) were submitted to the Norwegian National Forensic Toxicology Laboratory for analysis. The proportion of positive DrugWipe results that were unconfirmed when analysing blood samples was 82% for opiates, 75% for cocaine, and \u223c19%-20% for amphetamines, cannabis, and benzodiazepines. The proportion of negative DrugWipe results that were found positive in blood samples was for cannabis and benzodiazepines \u223c13%-14%, and for other drugs <3%. Detected drug traces in the used DrugWipe devices corresponded well with DrugWipe readouts for cannabis, amphetamines, and cocaine. The lack of correspondence between DrugWipe test results for cocaine and findings in blood may be due to the fact that the concentration of cocaine in saliva is often much higher than in blood, and the DrugWipe test is very sensitive. In addition, degradation and elimination of cocaine before the blood sample is taken may contribute to cocaine concentrations below the cut-off concentration in blood. For opiates and benzodiazepines, traces of drugs were found in relatively few DrugWipe devices. Many unconfirmed positives for opiates were most likely due to cross-reaction with substances in 'snus' (snuff tobacco).",

      "abstract": "QUESTION: A 3-year-old girl was brought to my office by her caregiver because she was not acting like herself. She was excessively sleepy, difficult to rouse, and had poor balance. The caregiver reported cannabis products in the home in the form of gummies the caregiver takes for sleep and anxiety. What symptoms should prompt consideration of marijuana ingestion and how should accidental ingestion be managed? ANSWER: Cannabis is one of the most widely used drugs in the world. Many countries are decriminalizing and legalizing marijuana, but its negative impact on pediatric health is growing. Current evidence shows unintentional marijuana ingestion and severe toxicity are steadily increasing. Common symptoms of marijuana ingestion in young children are drowsiness, somnolence, nausea, and vomiting, with children being at high risk for severe symptoms of respiratory depression and seizures. Primary care providers should talk to families about issues surrounding marijuana in the home, including safe storage of products containing cannabis and when to suspect an accidental ingestion. Public health should focus on the packaging and distribution of edibles to prevent easy access and accidental ingestion by young children.",

      "abstract": "The quantification of harmful elements in cannabis is a relevant analytical task that requires metrological tools to ensure the reliability of the measurement results. This work reports the preparation and characterization of a certified reference material (CRM) for toxic elements-arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), and lead (Pb)-in pulverized, lyophilized cannabis leaf tissue. To prepare the CRM INM-040-1, a portion of dried ground cannabis vegetal material was spiked with the elements at mass fraction values close to the levels of interest in relevant regulations for this kind of matrix: 0.34 mg/kg for arsenic, 0.34 mg/kg for cadmium, and 0.66 mg/kg for lead. The elements were quantified by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) in combination with graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy (GF-AAS, for cadmium and lead) or hydride generation atomic absorption spectroscopy (HG-AAS, for arsenic). The analytical calibration was done by gravimetric standard addition for ICP-MS and GF-AAS, while bracketing calibration was used for HG-AAS. Furthermore, internal standard correction was used during ICP-MS measurements. The analytical methods were validated to demonstrate their fitness for purpose. The preparation variables of the CRM (particle size, drying treatment, and spiking conditions) were studied to improve the homogeneity of the CRM. The mass fraction of the toxic elements was certified with relative standard uncertainties ranging from 4.2 to 6.9%. The uncertainty contributions considered were the elements' mass fraction measurements, the between-methods bias, the (in)homogeneity of the production batch, and the (in)stability under transport and storage conditions. This new CRM constitutes a useful tool for the laboratories assessing the harmlessness of cannabis materials, promoting humans' safety and regulatory compliance within the medicinal cannabis industry.",

      "abstract": "Synthetic cannabinoids (SCs) are novel psychoactive substances (NPS) that are highly potent and associated with a range of severe toxicities. SC use, which is common in UK prisons and homeless communities, typically involves combustion of SC-soaked herb or paper material. Recently, e-cigarettes (or vapes) have emerged as popular delivery vehicles for SCs, and consumption among the general population has risen significantly. SC-containing e-cigarettes (or e-liquids) are typically sold as imitation cannabis-containing products and carry increased risk of adverse outcomes including psychosis, seizure, and cardiac arrest. Numerous incidences of overdose have been reported in UK schools. SCs cannot be identified in complex e-liquid matrices using current field-portable detection technologies, preventing the rapid screening of suspicious products. Herein, we report on the design and development of a device that can rapidly detect SCs and other relevant drugs in sealed e-cigarettes and e-liquids. We describe and implement a method to artificially actuate an e-cigarette, simultaneously depositing e-liquid vapor onto a physical matrix. We couple this extraction method with fluorescence-based detection to create a rapid and generic test for SC-containing e-cigarettes. In addition, we expand the potential of the detection modality by leveraging the photochemical degradation of THC and nitazenes on a solid matrix as a means for their detection from e-liquids and sealed e-cigarettes. We show that SCs, delta-9-THC and nitazenes can be detected in e-liquid from concentrations 0.2, 5, and 1.5 mg/mL, respectively.",

On the other hand, residues enclosed major classes of bioactive compounds that could be extracted and used across various fields. This study aimed to elucidate the role of the endogenous microbial community in the lignocellulosic degradation of hemp residues for biorefineries or other industrial processes, simultaneously characterizing the composition of three extracts recovered at different stages of maceration. The process was examined from different perspectives: plant tissue degradation and microbial dynamics were monitored using histological, cultural-dependent, and independent analysis. Extracts were characterized through FTIR, NMR, and SDS-PAGE analyses, also evaluating their potential as biostimulants for microbial growth. Results revealed that the composition of the endogenous prokaryotic community remained stable during the maceration period, while fluctuations in various fungal genera were observed. The taxonomical composition of hemp residues at different stages may account for the increased accumulation of amide-containing compounds, sugars, and other metabolites detected in long-term bioconversion. Finally, the extracts recovered from the microbial degradation of hemp residues were able to support the growth of the yeast ",

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Evaluating medicinal cannabis in clinical trials is important for informing its efficacy and safety in clinical care. Alongside the inherent practical challenges of conducting clinical trials in people receiving palliative care, operationalizing clinical trials with a medicinal cannabis product requires additional consideration of legal, regulatory, ethical, feasibility, pharmacological and product requirements. OBJECTIVES: This manuscript aims to explore these considerations when operationalizing medicinal cannabis clinical trials in people receiving palliative care. METHODS: Our Phase I/IIb trial examined pharmacokinetic, toxicity and secondary (efficacy) outcomes of a vaporized medicinal cannabis product for anorexia in people with advanced cancer (ACTRN12616000516482). Using action research methodology, notes from trial investigator meetings served as an audit trail for the planning and execution of the trial. These data were integrated and synthesized to reveal key design considerations for operationalizing medicinal cannabis trials evaluating symptom control in people receiving palliative care. RESULTS: Six key considerations emerged including: 1) Operating within medicinal cannabis legislation; 2) Biological plausibility of cannabinoid type(s) and impact on target symptoms; 3) Standardising cannabinoid content, mode of administration, dosage and packaging; 4) Ethical and safety considerations; 5) Optimizing trial site operationalization; and 6) Pharmacy dispensing, storage and security of product. Learnings and recommendations for future trials are also discussed. CONCLUSION: This study explores the learnings and challenges involved in designing and conducting medicinal cannabis trials for symptom management in people receiving palliative care. These insights gained from our experience can inform the optimal design and operationalization of future medicinal cannabis trials in cancer and other chronic conditions.",

      "abstract": "Cannabidiol (CBD), one of the main actives from Cannabis sativa has been perpetually explored lately for its therapeutic effects. Its main attributes, such as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, snowball into pain management, epilepsy and seizure alleviation, anxiety relief, as well as numerous other implications through the entire metabolism. However, conventional administration routes challenge its therapeutic potential, with reported poor water solubility, hepatic degradation, gastric instability and erratic bioavailability observed in oral administration. As a result, the transdermal delivery systems have emerged as a promising alternative to oral or inhaled routes, offering improved bioavailability and targeted effects. The medical use of CBD throughout Europe, UK, USA or Australia is extensive and usually represented by pharmaceutical preparations recommended after conventional treatment routs fail. The non-medical use is limited by each country's own legislation, a wider range of products being available, but the irregular regulatory landscape coupled with the growing market of cannabinoid-infused products, emphasizes the need for standardized formulations and further clinical research. The present work critically examines the transdermal administration of cannabidiol, explores the skin's potential as a route and the strategies involved in using it for systemic targeting. We highlighted key challenges and provided insights into CBD`s variable bioavailability based on different administration routes and methods, thus compiling a literature-based absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) study. We also explore the role of the endocannabinoid system, its function in various medical conditions, and the therapeutic effects associated with CBD, particularly in light of the varying legislation across countries. While the breadth of potential benefits is compelling, it is essential to emphasize the ongoing nature of CBD research as individual responses to it can vary significantly.",

      "abstract": "The decriminalization and legalization of cannabis have increased its consumption and the need for effective monitoring methods. Synthetic cannabinoids, while chemically distinct from natural cannabinoids like THC, can be more potent and cause severe adverse effects, often evading detection by traditional drug tests. Thus, there is a critical need for new biosensors that offer rapid, sensitive, and reliable detection of these compounds in biological samples. This study presents a novel electrochemical immunosensor based on aminated MXene integrated with poly(propylene carbonate) (PPC) nanofibers and monoclonal antibodies designed to enhance the detection of synthetic cannabinoids. The PPC/MXene-NH\u2082 nanofibers, electrospun onto screen-printed electrodes (SPEs), provide increased surface area and high sensitivity, stability, and selectivity. The biosensor achieved a wide detection range of 0.6-2000\u00a0ng/mL in saliva, a low limit of detection (LOD) of 0.66\u00a0ng/mL, and demonstrated excellent specificity. It showed high repeatability and reproducibility with minimal signal degradation, with vacuum-sealed storage proving to significantly extend sensor stability over time. These results highlight the potential of MXene-enhanced PPC nanofiber immunosensors as sensitive, selective, and portable tools for rapid detection of synthetic cannabinoids in clinical and forensic settings.",

      "abstract": "An impact of legalization and decriminalization of marijuana is the gradual increase in the use of cannabis for recreational purposes, which poses a potential threat to society and healthcare systems worldwide. However, the discovery of receptor subtypes, endogenous endocannabinoids, and enzymes involved in synthesis and degradation, as well as pharmacological characterization of receptors, has led to exploration of the use of cannabis in multiple peripheral and central pathological conditions. The role of cannabis in the modulation of crucial events involving perturbed physiological functions and disease progression, including apoptosis, inflammation, oxidative stress, perturbed mitochondrial function, and the impaired immune system, indicates medicinal values. These events are involved in most neurological diseases and prompt the gradual progression of the disease. At present, several synthetic agonists and antagonists, in addition to more than 70 phytocannabinoids, are available with distinct efficacy as a therapeutic alternative in different pathological conditions. The present review aims to describe the use of cannabis in neurological diseases and psychiatric disorders.",

The child ingested an edible product containing tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and presented with lethargy, altered mental status, and increased muscle tone. The airway was protected, and the patient was breathing spontaneously. Initial assessment included a thorough history provided by the caregivers, which confirmed ingestion of cannabinoid gummies approximately two hours prior to presentation. An electrocardiogram demonstrated sinus tachycardia with a prolonged QTc. Toxicology screening was presumed positive for cannabinoids. Therapeutic management focused on supportive care. The patient was admitted to the hospital and discharged on hospital day two with no neurologic sequelae. The caregivers were provided with expectant management and counseled regarding safe storage and use of cannabis and cannabis-derived products. This case report discusses the growing incidence of cannabis exposure in the pediatric population while highlighting the biochemistry, clinical presentation, and therapeutic management of accidental ingestion of synthetic cannabinoids.",

      "abstract": "Atherosclerotic disease is the leading cause of death world-wide. Our goal was to explore the effect of phytocannabinoids on the molecular mechanisms triggering the development of the atheromatous lesion. Three cannabis sativa extracts of different chemotypes were chemically characterized by UPLC-DAD. The capacity of the extracts to prevent the oxidation of LDL, the formation of foam cells and the activation of an inflammatory response by J774 cells, were monitored by UV-Vis spectrometry, confocal-microscopy and western blot. Three varieties of cannabis sativa, with high (E1), intermediate (E2) and low (E3) THC/CBD ratios were selected. The three cannabis extracts inhibited the oxidation of LDL by copper ions and the formation of foam cells by J774.1 cells challenged with oxLDL (ED50 5-12 \u03bcg mL-1). The effect of the cannabinoid extracts on the endocytic process was independent of the canonical cannabinoid receptors, CB1 and CB2, but related to the action of non-canonical receptors (TRPV1, TRPV4 and GPR55), involved in calcium signaling. Decreased levels of CD36 and OLR1 scavenger receptors were, at least partially, responsible for the diminished uptake of oxLDL induced by phytocannabinoids. The downregulation of CD36 and OLR1 could be explained by the observed inhibitory effect of the cannabis extracts on the activation of the NF\u03baB pathway by oxLDL. Phytocannabinoids interfere with the main events leading to the development of the atheromatous plaque, opening new venues on atherosclerosis therapy.",

      "abstract": "Recent changes in legislation have put hempseed meal (Cannabis sativa L.; HSM) under consideration as a potential livestock feedstuff. Digestibility of HSM has been researched in other species, however, there are little data in horses. The study objective was to determine the in vitro true digestibility (IVTD) of HSM compared to common equine feedstuffs. An in vitro split-split plot design used four geldings (8.5 \u00b1 3.9yr; 558.4 \u00b1 31.0kg; 6.0 \u00b1 0.4 BCS) to investigate the IVTD of HSM compared to alfalfa hay (ALF), Coastal Bermudagrass hay (CBH), soybean meal (SBM), rice bran pellets (RBP), and a commercial concentrate (Bluebonnet Equilene Pellets; EQU). Fresh feces were collected after a 21-d acclimation period and used as incubation inoculum. Dried ground feed samples were incubated in ANKOM filter bags within 2 DaisyII incubators for 48h. Split samples were analyzed for pre-fermentation neutral detergent fiber (NDF). Incubated filter bags were dried and analyzed for NDF to determine IVTD and fiber degradation. Hempseed meal NDF was greater than ALF (P < 0.001), RBP (P < 0.001), and SBM (P < 0.001) but less than CBH (P < 0.001) and tended to be greater than EQU (P = 0.077). The IVTD of HSM was greater than CBH (P < 0.001) but less than all other feedstuffs (P < 0.001). The results indicate that HSM has an NDF and IVTD between ALF and CBH. Due to its lower digestibility and NDF content compared to concentrates, HSM has potential to be used as a fiber source in equine rations.",

      "abstract": "The interest in characterization of drugs abused started in 1948 with the aim of determining the origin of opium. After 75 years there is still a great interest in this approach, called geo-profiling, chemical or forensic profiling in the following decades. Recently chemical attribution signatures (CAS) were proposed by the authors who studied \"synthesis precursors and byproducts, impurities, degradation products, and metabolites in various biological matrices\" of fentanyl. Forensic profiling evolved during these decades: new analytical approaches were tested and it was applied to more and more products, which threaten the health and security of citizens worldwide. In substances of natural origins (e.g. opium, cannabis and cocaine), it is possible to exploit the great variability of both elements and organic chemical compounds and to study chemical compounds such as reagents and solvents, by-products, and cutting agents used in the production chain. Profiles can be used to classify products from different seizures into groups of similar samples (tactical intelligence) or to determine the origin of samples (strategic intelligence). Chromatographic approaches coupled to mass spectrometry are very common to determine organic profiles, while elemental profiles are obtained by nuclear activation analysis, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry or ion beam analysis. A very important role in the field is played by isotope ratio analysis. Approaches to obtain forensic profiles are available also for chemical warfare agents, explosives, illegal medicines, doping agents, supplements, food. Chemometrics can be particularly useful to establish the authenticity of products and for the interpretation of large amount of forensic data. The future of forensic profiling is a challenge for forensic sciences. Organized crime is involved in the manufacturing of a large number of illegal products and forensic profiling is a very powerful tool to support the health of citizens and the administration of justice worldwide.",

      "abstract": "The current development of industrial hemp \"Cannabis Sativa L.\" fibers for technical textiles and industrial applications requires high-quality fibers with homogeneous properties. However, several factors have been reported to influence the fibers' intrinsic properties, including a post-harvest process known as retting. This process plays a crucial role in facilitating the mechanical extraction of fibers from hemp stems. Retting involves the degradation of the amorphous components surrounding the fiber bundles enabling their decohesion from stems. Microorganisms play a central role in mediating this bioprocess. During retting, they colonize the stems' surface. Therefore, the biochemical components of plant cell wall, acting as natural binding between fibers, undergo a breakdown through the production of microbial enzymes. Although its critical role, farmers often rely on empirical retting practices, and considering various biotic and abiotic factors, resulting in fibers with heterogenous properties. These factors limit the industrial applications of hemp fibers due to their inconsistent properties. Thus, the purpose of this review is to enhance our comprehension of how retting influences the dynamics of microbial communities and, consequently, the evolution of the biochemical properties of hemp stems throughout this process. Better understanding of retting is crucial for effective process management, leading to high-value fibers. KEY POINTS: \u2022 Retting enables degradation of cell wall components, controlling fiber properties. \u2022 Microbial enzymatic activity is crucial for successful decohesion of fiber bundles. \u2022 Understanding retting mechanisms is essential for consistent fiber production.",

      "abstract": "Cannabinoids represent a highly researched group of plant-derived ingredients. The substantial investment of funds from state and commercial sources has facilitated a significant increase in knowledge about these ingredients. Cannabinoids can be classified into three principal categories: plant-derived phytocannabinoids, synthetic cannabinoids and endogenous cannabinoids, along with the enzymes responsible for their synthesis and degradation. All of these compounds interact biologically with type 1 (CB1) and/or type 2 (CB2) cannabinoid receptors. A substantial body of evidence from in vitro and in vivo studies has demonstrated that cannabinoids and inhibitors of endocannabinoid degradation possess anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antitumour and antifibrotic properties with beneficial effects. This review, which spans the period from 1940 to 2024, offers an overview of the potential therapeutic applications of natural and synthetic cannabinoids. The development of these substances is essential for the global market of do-it-yourself drugs to fully exploit the promising therapeutic properties of cannabinoids.",

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic joint condition marked by gradual degradation of the cartilage and commonly associated with elevated levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). However, the influence of cannabiorcol on OA and its underlying mechanisms remains unclear. METHODS: In silico analysis investigated the key transcription factors that regulate MMP expression. A chondrocyte cell model [interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and IL-1\u237a-treated C20A4 cell line] was established and treated with cannabiorcol. Associated cytotoxicity was assessed using a WST-8 assay. A monoiodoacetate-induced OA rat model was established and treated with cannabiorcol. Protein translocation and transactivation analyses were conducted using immunofluorescence and dual-luciferase reporter assays, respectively. Western blotting and real-time PCR analyzed relevant markers to examine cannabiorcol's effects on OA and its fundamental mechanisms. RESULTS: Cannabiorcol inhibits the expression of IL-1\u03b2-induced MMPs compared to other cannabis-related compounds. In silico analysis revealed that the nuclear factor-kappa \u03b2 (NF-\u03ba\u03b2) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways are associated with MMP expression as key regulators. In vitro, cannabiorcol inhibits the NF-\u03baB and p38 MAPK pathways independently cannabinoid receptors and transient receptor potential vanilloids. In vivo, cannabiorcol reduces MMP expression and ameliorates monoiodoacetate-induced OA traits in rats. CONCLUSION: Cannabiorcol inhibits IL-1\u03b2-induced MMP expression in vitro and alleviates OA in an MIA-induced OA rat model by reducing MMP expression and inhibiting the p65/p38 axis.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Cannabis sativa L. is renowned for its medicinal and recreational uses. With the increasing global legalization of C.\u00a0sativa L.-based products for medicinal purposes, there is a growing need for well-characterized products. While the stability of cannabinoids such as tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol is well understood, information on the chemical and enantiomeric stability of terpenes remains scarce. This is despite the fact that terpenes are also thought to have pharmacological activity and may contribute to the overall effect of C.\u00a0sativa L. METHODS: To address these challenges, four analytical methods based on chiral, polar, and apolar gas chromatographic separation combined with either MS or FID detection were developed and validated. These methods successfully separated and quantified a total of 29 terpenes, including 13 enantiomers and 5 diastereomers specific to C.\u00a0sativa L. Furthermore, terpenes and authentic C.\u00a0sativa L. flowers and extracts were subjected to UV and heat treatments to observe potential degradation reactions over time. RESULTS: Each terpene generates a unique pattern of degradation products resulting in a diverse array of oxidation and cyclization products. P-cymene was identified as a major product of terpene aging. Notably, no enantiomeric conversion was detected, suggesting that the formation of (-)-\u03b1-pinene in cannabis extracts, for example, originates from other terpenes. CONCLUSION: Terpenes have different degradation rates, even though they are structurally similar. In addition, cultivar- and growth-condition-specific enantiomeric ratios were observed in C.\u00a0sativa L., confirming that enantiomer production is species-specific and has to be considered for therapeutical applications.",

      "abstract": "Cannabinoid decarboxylation via thermo-chemical conversion has the potential to reduce the cannabinoid degradation and evaporation due to short reaction time and use of water as the solvent. When combined with pressurized liquid extraction (PLE), thermo-chemical conversion can be performed as the first stage in the extraction procedure. PLE utilizes a closed system at elevated temperatures and pressure to increase the solvation power, which contributes to decreased viscosity and increased diffusion rate. With this new in-extraction decarboxylation approach there remain variables that need full understanding before up scaling from bench top to pilot or commercial scale. Herein, the thermo-chemical decarboxylation kinetics was studied for industrial hemp via PLE at different temperatures (80-160\u00a0\u00b0C) and reaction times (1-90\u00a0min). The reaction was found to be pseudo-first order. Model verification on CBD and CBG resulted in acceptable results; however, an anomaly in the minor cannabinoids suggests that cannabinoid concentration may influence model kinetics.",

      "abstract": "The outbreak of e-cigarette or vaping use-associated lung injury (EVALI) in the United States in 2019 led to a total of 2807 hospitalizations with 68 deaths. While the exact causes of this vaping-related lung illness are still being debated, laboratory analyses of products from victims of EVALI have shown that vitamin E acetate (VEA), an additive in some tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-containing products, is strongly linked to the EVALI outbreak. Because of its similar appearance and viscosity to pure THC oil, VEA was used as a diluent agent in cannabis oils in illicit markets. A potential mechanism for EVALI may involve VEA's thermal decomposition product, ketene, a highly poisonous gas, being generated under vaping conditions. In this study, a novel approach was developed to evaluate ketene production from VEA vaping under measurable temperature conditions in real-world devices. Ketene in generated aerosols was captured by two different chemical agents and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The LC-MS/MS method takes advantage of the high sensitivity and specificity of tandem mass spectrometry and appears to be more suitable than GC-MS for the analysis of large batches of samples. Our results confirmed the formation of ketene when VEA was vaped. The production of ketene increased with repeat puffs and showed a correlation to temperatures (200 to 500 \u00b0C) measured within vaping devices. Device battery power strength, which affects the heating temperature, plays an important role in ketene formation. In addition to ketene, the organic oxidant duroquinone was also obtained as another thermal degradation product of VEA. Ketene was not detected when vitamin E was vaped under the same conditions, confirming the importance of the acetate group for its generation.",

Recent data have shown that the endocannabinoid system is responsible for maintaining the homeostasis of various skin functions such as proliferation, differentiation and release of inflammatory mediators. Because of their role in regulating these key processes, cannabinoids have been studied for the treatment of skin cancers and melanoma; their anti-tumour effects regulate skin cancer progression and are mainly related to the inhibition of tumour growth, proliferation, invasion and angiogenesis, through apoptosis and autophagy induction.

RESULTS: Our results indicated that pre-drying mild trimming yielded the highest cannabinoid concentration, possibly due to optimal balance between stress signals and precursor influx from the sugar leaves to the inflorescence. On the other, post-drying trimming yielded the highest terpene content. CONCLUSION: Identifying the optimal trimming conditions that maximize both cannabinoid and terpene levels in cannabis is challenging. Therefore, growers face a decision in their trimming practices: to prioritize either enhanced cannabinoid content or increased aromatic terpene concentrations, as optimizing for both simultaneously appears to be difficult.",

The secretory cavity contents acquired from the capitate-stalked glandular trichomes by glass microcapillaries, and inflorescence samples air-dried for 15\u00a0days of storage in darkness at room temperature were analysed by high-pressure liquid chromatography. The ratio of acidic cannabinoids to the total cannabinoids was ranging from 0.5% to 2.4% lower in the air-dried inflorescence samples compared to the secretory cavity samples as follows. In the secretory cavity content, the percentage of acidic cannabinoids to the total cannabinoids was measured as 86.4% cannabidiolic acid (CBDA), 6.5% tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA), 4.3% cannabichromenic acid (CBCA), 1.4% cannabigerolic acid (CBGA), and 0.6% cannabidivarinic acid (CBDVA), respectively.

Optimisation of AEE extraction parameters, including pH, enzyme concentration (hemicellulase, protease and pectinase), temperature and incubation time, to maximize oil yield was achieved using response surface methodology with a central composite design. For comparison, the solvent extraction (Soxhlet) (SE) method was also used. Optimized hydrolysis conditions involved incubation for 4 hours at 60\u00b0C with a pH of 6.5, using a multi-enzyme preparation comprising protease, hemicellulase and pectinase at concentrations of 55, 202.5 and 234 U/mg, respectively. Referring to the conventional Soxhlet extraction (SE), Aqueous Enzymatic Extraction (AEE) achieved a 30.65% oil recovery rate under the optimized parameters mentioned above. The use of enzymes produced an oil that was more stable against oxidation than the solvent-extracted oil, with a peroxide value (PV) of 19.54 and 47.87 meq O ",
