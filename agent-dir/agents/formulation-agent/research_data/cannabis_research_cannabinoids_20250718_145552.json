    "title": "Synaptic signatures of perinatal cannabinoids: A systematic review of rodent hippocampal synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory.",
    "abstract": "The expanding legalization of cannabis raises significant public health concerns about its use during pregnancy, particularly due to the limited understanding of its impact on neurodevelopment. Existing research suggests that perinatal cannabis or cannabinoid exposure may impair learning and memory; however, variations in study design hinder the ability to draw generalizable conclusions. Clinical studies are limited in their observational nature and the lack of insight into neural or cellular mechanisms underlying cognitive changes, underscoring the importance of preclinical studies to explore the effects of perinatal cannabinoids in greater detail. The objective of this systematic review is to consolidate findings from existing preclinical research that investigates the effects of perinatal cannabinoid exposure on learning and memory and the putative mechanism of learning and memory, hippocampal synaptic plasticity, in rodents. This review summarizes studies on hippocampal synaptic plasticity (n\u2009=\u20092), spatial/visual memory (n\u2009=\u200913), working memory (n\u2009=\u20096), recognition memory (n\u2009=\u200912), and associative memory (n\u2009=\u20097). Perinatal cannabinoid-induced impairments were reported in the two synaptic plasticity studies, and in 24 out of 30 studies that examined learning and memory, with spatial memory tasks showing the most consistent deficits. While the existing evidence converges on the notion that perinatal cannabinoid exposure negatively impacts hippocampal physiology and associated memory functions, further research is needed to disentangle the influence of various methodological factors, including offspring sex and age, cannabinoid type, time of gestational exposure, and method of administration.",

    "title": "Changes in and correlates of cannabis-involved substance use treatment admissions age 50 and older, 2000-2021.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Cannabis use among U.S. older adults has risen rapidly over the past two decades. This study examined the changes in and correlates of cannabis-involved substance use treatment admissions among this demographic. METHODS: Using the 2000-2021 concatenated Treatment Episode Data Set-Admissions (TEDS-A) age 50+ ( RESULTS: During the study period, the number of cannabis-involved admissions increased substantially, while their share of all admissions increased and then decreased as other drug-related admissions increased. The annual percentage changes (APC) show that the shares of cannabis-involved admissions of all admissions between 2000 and 2012 increased for the 50-64 age group and then decreased between 2012 and 2021. In the 65+ age group, the shares increased between 2000 and 2016 (APC=5.2) and then plateaued. Compared to no-cannabis admissions, the likelihood (relative risk ratio) of all cannabis-involved admissions was higher among males, black people, residents of states where medical or recreational cannabis use was legal, and referrals from healthcare providers and court/criminal legal systems. The likelihood (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]) of cannabis-primary admissions was higher among those age 65+ (aOR=1.04, 95%CI=1.00-1.08), black people (aOR=1.34, 95% CI=1.32-1.36), Hispanic people (aOR=1.26, 95% CI=1.23-1.29), residents of states with medical cannabis laws, and those who were referred by healthcare providers and legal systems. IMPLICATIONS: Cannabis-involved admissions are projected to continue to increase as cannabis use continues to increase. More effective regulations and enforcement of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol potency and research on cannabis harms and poly-substance use are needed to protect the health of older adults who turn to cannabis for its purported health benefits. Increased availability and accessibility of treatment infrastructure are also needed.",

    "title": "Machine-learning of medical cannabis chemical profiles reveals analgesia beyond placebo expectations.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The efficacy of medical cannabis in alleviating pain has been demonstrated in clinical trials, yet questions remain regarding the extent to which specific chemical compounds contribute to analgesia versus expectation-based (placebo) responses. Effective blinding is notoriously difficult in cannabis trials, complicating the identification of compound-specific effects. METHODS: In a prospective study of 329 chronic pain patients (40% females; aged 48.9\u2009\u00b1\u200915.5) prescribed medical cannabis, we examined whether the chemical composition of cannabis cultivars could predict treatment outcomes. We used a Random Forest classifier with nested cross-validation to assess the predictive value of demographics, clinical features, and approximately 200 chemical compounds. Model robustness was evaluated using six additional machine learning algorithms. RESULTS: Here we show that incorporating chemical composition markedly improves the prediction of pain relief (AUC\u2009=\u20090.63\u2009\u00b1\u20090.10) compared to models using only demographic and clinical features (AUC\u2009=\u20090.52\u2009\u00b1\u20090.09; p\u2009<\u20090.001). This result is consistent across all models tested. While well-known cannabinoids such as THC and CBD provide limited predictive value, specific terpenoids, particularly \u03b1-Bisabolol and eucalyptol, emerge as key predictors of treatment response. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that pain relief can be predicted from cannabis chemical profiles that are unknown to patients, providing evidence for compound-specific therapeutic effects. These results highlight the importance of considering the full range of cannabis compounds when developing more precise and effective cannabis-based therapies for pain management.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alcohol and delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) (main impairing ingredient of cannabis) are both crash contributors that interfere with motor vehicle operation. However, the relationship between drug concentration and crash injury severity is unclear for either drug. We aim to clarify the relationship between blood alcohol concentration (BAC) and crash injury severity, based on healthcare system utilisation, with and without THC. METHODS: The National Drug Driving Study is an ongoing prospective study involving 17 Canadian trauma centres. Eligible subjects included drivers aged 16+ who visited a participating trauma centre and had blood drawn as part of routine care within 6\u2009hours of a crash. Deidentified blood samples were tested for alcohol and THC using gas chromatography-flame ionisation detection and liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. Study outcomes included admission to hospital and admitted patients' length of hospital stay. RESULTS: 10\u2009322 injured drivers visited a participating trauma centre between 2018 and 2023. 1649 (16.0%), 1716 (16.6%) and 463 (4.5%) drivers had detectable levels of alcohol, THC or both, respectively. Compared with sober drivers (BAC=0), drivers with 0%<BAC<0.08% had increased odds of admission (aOR=1.69, 95%\u2009CI=1.31 to 2.19), as did drivers with BAC\u22650.08% (aOR=1.36, 95%\u2009CI=1.16 to 1.60). THC did not modify the relationship between alcohol and admission. Neither alcohol nor THC predicted were associated with length of stay following admission. INTERPRETATION: Alcohol increases hospital admissions after crashes but does not have a dose-response relationship with admission or length of stay. THC does not moderate this relationship.",

Today, a wide variety of cannabis products and alternatives are available in the legal and illicit markets. Harms associated with their use may vary depending on the amount and type of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) they contain. Few studies have examined the awareness of and use of these different cannabis products among adolescents. METHODS: Our study examined patterns of cannabis use in adolescent patients of an urban pediatric addiction clinic. RESULTS: Most adolescents seen at the clinic use multiple cannabis products, and many adolescents use cannabinoid derivatives such as delta-8 and delta-10 THC. DISCUSSION: These results highlight the need for providers to explore in depth the various cannabis products used by adolescents, educate adolescents on the products, especially due to unknown risks associated with cannabinoid derivatives, and advocate for further regulation of alternative cannabis products.",

    "abstract": "Cannabis use during pregnancy is increasing, often to alleviate stress and anxiety, yet the long-term effect of prenatal cannabis exposure alone or in combination with psychosocial stress on offspring neurodevelopment or maternal behaviors remains unclear. Here, we developed a translational rodent model combining prenatal \u0394\u2079-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) exposure with chronic psychosocial stress using the maternal witness defeat stress (MWDS) paradigm. Pregnant C57BL/6 mice were exposed to MWDS from gestational day (GD) 3-12 and received daily subcutaneous THC (2 mg/kg) or vehicle until birth. All exposure groups showed impaired maternal behavior, with negative postnatal outcomes and caregiving, with additive effects observed in the combined exposure group. In adolescence, male and female offspring exhibited exposure-specific behavioral alterations. Prenatal stress and combined exposures led to increased anxiety-like behavior and reduced motivated behavior in both sexes, while THC alone primarily impacted female self-care and social behavior. Transcriptomic profiling of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) of adolescent offspring revealed sex- and region-specific gene expression changes across all exposure groups. Prenatal THC-, stress-, and combined exposures each altered distinct molecular pathways related to mitochondrial function, synaptic organization, and glial signaling. Comparative analysis with a perinatal fentanyl model revealed shared transcriptional substrates involved in synaptic signaling and circadian regulation. These findings indicate that THC and stress independently and additively impair maternal behaviors with lasting neurodevelopment signatures in offspring.",

The objective of this study is to assess risk perceptions of cannabis and CBD use during pregnancy among pregnant and non-pregnant patients. METHODS: The study design is multi-method; a cross-sectional survey assessing use behaviors and risk perceptions is supplemented with qualitative focus group discussions (FGDs). Recruitment for surveys was from outpatient obstetrics clinics and recruitment for FGDs was from the same clinics and a substance-use treatment clinic, from October 2022 to February 2023. The survey instrument was developed via combining question items from validated instruments that assess cannabis and CBD use and risk perceptions. Comparisons of response frequency distributions for pregnant versus non-pregnant participants were calculated with chi-square analysis for individual risk perception question items. Data from the FGDs were coded and analyzed via a deductive content analysis approach. RESULTS: There were 261 survey respondents and 5 FGDs ( CONCLUSION: Findings indicate uncertainty of risk related to cannabis and CBD use during pregnancy regardless of current pregnancy or lactation status, despite prevalent ever use of cannabis and CBD in those who were pregnant. This suggests an urgent need for clearer risk communication about cannabis and CBD use in pregnancy.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Cannabis-based products for medicinal use, also referred to as cannabinoid-containing products, particularly those containing cannabidiol as the primary active constituent, have shown to be a possible alternative in treating various health conditions in companion animals. Thus, this systematic review aims to synthesise and analyse the available data on the efficacy/effectiveness and safety of cannabis-based products for medicinal use in dogs and cats to assist in clinical decision-making. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review was conducted across PubMed, LILACS, Scopus, and Google Scholar from February 2014 to February 2024. The search strategy included both MeSH terms and free-text keywords related to medical cannabis, including Medical Marijuana, Cannabis and Cannabaceae, combined with terms referring to domestic cats and dogs. Additionally, title/abstract keywords, including Cannab (as a truncated term), were used to retrieve literature on cannabinoids and their therapeutic applications. RESULTS: Twenty-two articles were identified examining cannabidiol-based formulations for osteoarthritis, epilepsy, atopic dermatitis, postsurgical pain, and behavioural issues. Cannabis-based products for medicinal use with cannabidiol as the primary active constituent demonstrated improvements in pain, behaviour, and seizures, with no serious adverse events. However, research on their use in cats is limited to two studies. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: While promising, the long-term efficacy/effectiveness, optimal dosages, and safety of cannabis-based products for medicinal use remain unclear. Further studies are needed to confirm their therapeutic potential and ensure safe veterinary use.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common liver disorder caused by oxidative stress and dysregulation of lipid metabolism. The endocannabinoid system (ECS), particularly the type 1 cannabinoid (CB1) receptor, plays a crucial role in NAFLD progression. Cannabinoids, such as cannabidiol (CBD) and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), along with terpenes, such as beta-myrcene and d-limonene, have shown potential therapeutic effects on liver health, particularly in reducing oxidative stress and modulating lipid metabolism. This study aimed to analyse the effects of five cannabis oils (COs), each with different CBD:THC ratios and terpenes content, on hypertension, dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis, oxidative stress, and CB1 receptor expression in an experimental model of NAFLD induced by a sucrose-rich diet (SRD) in Wistar rats for 3 weeks. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were fed either a: (1) reference diet (RD; standard commercial laboratory diet) or a: (2) sucrose-rich diet (SRD) for 3 weeks. 3 to 7 SRD\u2009+\u2009CO as following: (3) SRD\u2009+\u2009THC; (4) SRD\u2009+\u2009CBD; (5) SRD\u2009+\u2009CBD:THC 1:1; (6) SRD\u2009+\u2009CBD:THC 2:1; and (7) SRD\u2009+\u2009CBD:THC 3:1. The COs were administered orally at a dose of 1.5\u00a0mg total cannabinoids/kg body weight daily. The cannabinoid and terpenes content of all COs used in the study was determined. The terpenes found in COs were beta-myrcene, d-limonene, terpinolene, linalool, beta-caryophyllene, alpha-humulene, (-)-guaiol, (-)-alpha-bisabolol. During the experimental period, body weight, food intake and blood pressure were measured. Serum glucose, triglyceride, total cholesterol, uric acid, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (AP) levels were evaluated. Liver tissue histology, NAFLD activity score (NAS), triglyceride and cholesterol content, lipogenic enzyme activities, enzyme related to mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, reactive oxygen species (ROS), thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS), and antioxidant enzyme activities were also evaluated. The CB1 receptor expression was also determined. RESULTS: The results showed that SRD-fed rats developed hypertension, dyslipidemia, liver damage, hepatic steatosis, lipid peroxidation, and oxidative stress. This was accompanied by upregulation of liver CB1 receptor expression. CBD-rich CO, CBD:THC 1:1 ratio CO; CBD:THC 2:1 ratio CO and CBD:THC 3:1 ratio CO showed antihypertensive properties. THC-rich CO, CBD:THC 1:1 ratio CO; CBD:THC 2:1 ratio CO showed the greatest beneficial effects against hepatic steatosis and liver damage. All COs exhibited antioxidant effects in liver tissue. This was associated with normal liver CB1 receptor expression. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that COs, particularly THC-rich CO, CBD:THC ratio 1:1 CO, CBD:THC ratio 2:1 CO and terpenes, can effectively reduce dyslipidemia, liver damage and hepatic steatosis in SRD-induced NAFLD. COs with a higher proportion of CBD in their composition showed antihypertensive properties. All the COs exhibited antioxidant properties. These findings suggest that COs, especially those with CBD:THC ratios of 1:1 and 2:1 and terpenes, may represent a promising therapeutic approach for managing NAFLD and preventing its progression to more severe liver disease.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Cystic echinococcosis is a parasitic zoonosis caused by the larval stage of Echinococcus granulosus sensu lato. Albendazole (ABZ) is the drug of choice, although its efficacy is variable. The present research aimed to assess the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of a full-spectrum extract of Cannabis sativa inflorescences against E. granulosus sensu stricto (s.s.). METHODS: Protoscoleces and cysts were incubated in vitro with the C. sativa extract, achieving final CBD concentrations of 1, 5, 10, and 50\u00a0\u00b5g/ml. Viability was evaluated periodically. Structural and ultrastructural alterations were also recorded. For the clinical efficacy study, female CF-1 mice were infected. Six months later, mice were divided into groups (n\u2009=\u200910): (a) water control; (b) ABZ; (c) C. sativa extract, and (d) ABZ\u2009+\u2009C. sativa extract. Treatments were administered every 24\u00a0h for 30 days. The efficacy of the treatments was evaluated according to the weight of the cysts collected and the ultrastructural alterations observed. RESULTS: The C. sativa extract caused a significant decrease in the viability of protoscoleces and cysts in vitro. The greatest effect was observed with 50\u00a0\u00b5g/ml, which generated the reduction in protoscoleces viability to 0% between 6 and 24\u00a0h post-incubation (pi) and the collapse of 92\u2009\u00b1\u200913% of the cysts after 24\u00a0h pi. All the in vivo treatments reduced the weight of the cysts and caused ultrastructural alterations, especially the combination of ABZ\u2009+\u2009C. sativa extract. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of a full-spectrum extract of C. sativa inflorescences against E. granulosus s.s.",

    "title": "In Silico Assessment of Cannabidiol From Cannabis sativa as an Antiviral Agent Against Key Shrimp Pathogens in Aquaculture.",
    "abstract": "Shrimp aquaculture plays a crucial role in global food production but is increasingly threatened by viral and microsporidian pathogens such as White Spot Syndrome Virus (WSSV), Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei (EHP) and Infectious Hypodermal and Haematopoietic Necrosis Virus (IHHNV). Conventional reliance on antibiotics to combat these infections has raised serious concerns regarding antimicrobial resistance, environmental contamination and food safety. Additionally, environmental stressors such as salinity shifts and poor water quality exacerbate disease outbreaks, leading to severe production losses across Asia and Latin America. To explore eco-friendly therapeutic alternatives, this study assessed the antiviral potential of cannabidiol (CBD), a bioactive compound extracted from Cannabis sativa seed oil, identified through GC-MS analysis. Using molecular docking techniques, we evaluated CBD's interactions with key viral proteins: VP28 of WSSV, the tubulin \u03b2-chain of EHP and the capsid protein of IHHNV. The docking results revealed strong binding affinities of -6.61\u2009kcal/mol (EHP), -6.72\u2009kcal/mol (IHHNV) and -5.38\u2009kcal/mol (WSSV), indicating stable and potentially inhibitory interactions. Structural models were retrieved from RCSB PDB and SwissModel, while ligand preparation and docking were performed using AutoDock 4.2. CBD also demonstrated favourable pharmacokinetic and safety profiles, with predictions indicating no mutagenicity, hepatotoxicity or cardiotoxicity, and acceptable drug-likeness characteristics. Compared to other plant-derived compounds previously tested in shrimp disease models, CBD exhibited superior binding stability, more interaction residues and better bioavailability scores. These findings highlight CBD as a promising dual-function agent, capable of both modulating shrimp immunity and directly inhibiting key viral pathogens. These findings highlight cannabidiol (CBD) as a promising dual-action compound, with the potential to both enhance shrimp immune responses and exert direct antiviral effects against key pathogens. This study lays a robust groundwork for future in\u00a0vivo validations, formulation strategies and regulatory frameworks, ultimately supporting the development of sustainable, precision-based aquaculture health management.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Among diverse chemical profile of  METHODS: We explored 14 cannabinoids with an inverse molecular docking approach, docking each cannabinoid into  RESULTS: Our analysis of the inverse molecular docking results identified high scoring targets with potential as novel protein targets for minor cannabinoids, the majority associated with cancer, while others have connections with neurological disorders and inflammation. We highlighted GTPase KRas and hematopoietic cell kinase (HCK) as very promising potential targets due to favorable docking scores with almost all investigated cannabinoids. We also find multiple matrix metalloproteinases among the top targets, suggesting possible novel therapeutic opportunities in rheumatic diseases. An analysis of inverse molecular docking fingerprints shows similar binding patterns for cannabinoids with similar structures, minor structural differences still suffice to change the affinity to specific targets. Hierarchical clustering of inverse molecular docking fingerprints revealed two main clusters in protein binding pattern similarity, the first encompassing THC-class and similar cannabinoids, as well as CBL-class cannabinoids, while the second contained CBD, CBC, and CBG-class cannabinoids. Notably, CBL-class cannabinoids exhibited binding patterns more similar to THC-class cannabinoids than their CBC-class precursors, possibly offering potential therapeutic benefits akin to THC with fewer psychotropic effects. DISCUSSION: This study highlights the therapeutic potential of minor cannabinoids and identifies their potential novel protein targets. Moreover, we demonstrate the utility of inverse molecular docking fingerprinting with clustering to identify compounds with similar binding patterns as well as identify pharmacophore-related compounds in a structurally agnostic manner, paving the way for future drug discovery and development.",

However, CBD crosses the placenta and accumulates in the fetal brain, where it can activate or repress the function of several molecular targets that are important for brain development. While consumption of high doses of CBD during pregnancy have been shown to disrupt offspring neurodevelopment and postnatal behavior, lower, more clinically relevant doses have not been assessed. Here, we show that oral consumption of 10 mg/kg/day CBD during pregnancy increases thermal pain sensitivity in exposed male mouse offspring. Additionally, we find that the same dose impairs cognition and reduces excitability of the prefrontal cortex in exposed female mouse offspring. These data show that lower doses of CBD consumption during pregnancy can impair fetal brain development and postnatal behavior.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The use of medicinal cannabis is increasing worldwide and has applications in managing a wide range of conditions, including neurological, rheumatological, and gastrointestinal diseases. Despite its growing prevalence, there are limited data on patterns of cannabis prescription across varying disease groups and demographic subgroups. METHODS: This retrospective observational cohort study analysed cannabis usage patterns among 263 patients from the cannabis user clinic at Rabin Medical center (RMC), a tertiary hospital in Israel. To minimise the inclusion of recreational cannabis users, only patients aged 30 years and older were included. Patients were categorised into three groups based on their primary medical condition: neurological (n\u2009=\u200963), rheumatological (n\u2009=\u2009106), and gastrointestinal (n\u2009=\u200994). Data collected included: demographic information, cannabis dosage, Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content, cultivated variety preference (sativa vs. Indica), and method of consumption (smoking vs. oil). Statistical analyses were conducted using ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, chi-square, and t-tests to compare cannabis prescription patterns between disease and demographic groups. RESULTS: Significant differences in cannabis prescription patterns were observed across disease groups. Patients with gastrointestinal conditions were prescribed the highest mean monthly cannabis dose (22.26\u2009\u00b1\u200913.60\u00a0g), while those with neurological conditions had the highest oil consumption (31.75%). Sex-based differences were notable, with male patients being prescribed significantly higher doses of cannabis (25.48\u2009\u00b1\u200915.15\u00a0g) and higher THC content (14\u2009\u00b1\u20096.56%) compared to female patients (17.32\u2009\u00b1\u20099.93\u00a0g; THC: 11.39\u2009\u00b1\u20096.48%). DISCUSSION: The study highlights variations in cannabis prescription patterns based on both medical conditions and demographic factors. Male patients received higher doses and THC-rich formulations, while patients with gastrointestinal conditions had the highest cannabis prescription overall. These findings suggest the need for individualised cannabis therapy based on patient characteristics and the specific condition being treated. CONCLUSION: Medicinal cannabis usage patterns vary significantly across disease and demographic groups. Personalised cannabis treatment plans, informed by both clinical and demographic factors, are essential to optimising patient outcomes. Further research is needed to develop more precise guidelines for prescribing medicinal cannabis.",

    "abstract": "Natural variation in secondary metabolites is commonplace in organic matrices, including consumable fruits and vegetables. However, absolute concentration and variation of secondary metabolites are generally not of concern to consumers. Cannabis sativa and C. indica dried cannabis total Delta-9 Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is of importance to consumers/patients and must be accurately reported for both recreational and medical dried flower. In this report, the variation in Total THC in THC-dominant commercially relevant cultivars was investigated. The variation in Total THC values within different strata of the plant and between plants of the same batch were explored using a single analytical method. Within one stratum across nine batches (n\u2009=\u200927-57), Total THC varied by 3.1-6.7% of actual content, with only\u2009~\u200930-41% of individual replicates falling within their respective 99% confidence internal (CI) (representative of the batch mean). Between the top and bottom of plants across three batches, Total THC varied by 4.7-6.1% of actual THC content. Between plants of one cultivar, average Total THC varied by 2.8% which was statistically significant (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). Effect size (ES) measures were also reported for plant strata and plant against plant analysis. A comprehensive analysis of the extent of Total THC variation in samples of dried cannabis, evident both within and across plants of the same batch, has been presented using a random sampling and sample size calculated approach. Herein we demonstrate the natural variability present in dried cannabis flower using a single analytical method.",

    "abstract": "Cannabis use represents a significant risk factor for both psychotic disorders and suicidal behaviors, with growing evidence suggesting complex interactions between these variables. This systematic review examines the relationship between cannabis use and suicide risk in first-episode psychosis (FEP) patients, and explores underlying mechanisms, moderating factors, and intervention strategies. Following PRISMA guidelines, we analyzed 50 studies involving 12,764 FEP patients. Results demonstrate that cannabis use, especially high-potency cannabis used regularly, is associated with significantly increased suicide risk with studies consistently reporting elevated odds ratios (ranging from 1.43 to 1.84), and dose-dependent effects-daily use showing higher risk (studies reporting OR: 2.73, 95\u202f% CI: 1.89-3.94) and high-THC cannabis carrying greatest risk (OR: 3.12, 95\u202f% CI: 2.11-4.62). Multiple mechanisms mediate this relationship: neurobiological alterations in the endocannabinoid system, exacerbation of depressive symptoms, impaired cognitive functions, increased duration of untreated psychosis, and reduced treatment adherence. Key vulnerability factors include early-onset cannabis use (before age 15-16), female gender, history of childhood trauma, and comorbid psychiatric disorders. Critical high-risk periods were identified, particularly the first month after treatment initiation and following hospital discharge. Effective intervention strategies include integrated early intervention programs combining pharmacological treatment with psychosocial approaches, specifically cognitive-behavioral therapy, motivational interviewing, and family interventions. Emerging evidence suggests potential therapeutic benefits of CBD and specific risk management protocols. This review highlights the clinical importance of assessing cannabis use patterns in FEP patients and implementing targeted interventions during critical periods, particularly given the increasing availability of high-potency cannabis products globally.",
