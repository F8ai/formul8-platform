    "title": "Wisconsin Young Adults' Attitudes, Beliefs, Motivations, and Behaviors Surrounding E-Cigarette Use and Cessation.",
    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use is prevalent among young adults, yet cessation treatment options are limited and underutilized. METHODS: Wisconsin residents aged 18 to 24 who had vaped nicotine in the past month (N\u2009=\u2009480) completed an online survey assessing vaping initiation, past quit experiences, future quit intentions, and treatment knowledge and preferences. The survey also assessed perceived physical and mental health harms of vaping nicotine and other products (eg, cannabis, cannabidiol). RESULTS: Most young adults had made a prior e-cigarette quit attempt, commonly motivated by concerns about addiction, cost, and health problems. Though 80% want support to quit, preferred methods of support were highly variable. The same methods (eg, medication, friends/family, health care provider, therapist) that were most endorsed as the form of support young adults were most likely to use were also among the most endorsed forms of support that young adults would not want to use. Nearly 40% of participants reported vaping cannabis and perceived vaping cannabis as significantly less harmful than vaping nicotine or tobacco for physical and mental health. CONCLUSIONS: Vaping cessation resources that are responsive to young adults' needs and preferences are needed. The high variability in treatment preferences suggests that multiple strategies need to be offered; there is no one-size-fits-all approach. Cannabis vaping is prevalent, and an important area for future research is to examine the impact of cannabis vaping on nicotine vaping dependence, cessation, and treatment use. Strategies to reach, motivate, and engage young adults in e-cigarette cessation and cessation treatment should highlight their concerns about addiction, costs, health harms, and desired treatment options.",

    "title": "[The cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome-A narrative review].",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Until 25\u00a0years ago cyclic vomiting attacks under the chronic influence of cannabis were virtually unknown. Following the legalization of non-medical cannabis in North America and the associated increase in cannabis use, including high-potency strains, the number of patients there with cannabis-related cyclic vomiting is increasing. The ROME-IV criteria now define cannabis-induced cyclic vomiting as cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS). This review aims to provide information about CHS, as an increase in cases is also to be expected in Germany following legalization. METHOD: Selective review article. RESULTS: The CHS is most frequently registered in emergency departments. A\u00a0clear differentiation between CHS and cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS), in which one third of those affected also regularly use cannabis, is only possible by establishing full remission during a\u00a06-12\u00a0month cannabis abstinence. Therefore, mixed forms of CVS and CHS are initially seen in emergency departments (suspected CHS), also with hidden life-threatening abdominal comorbidities. Severe vomiting can also lead to serious complications. The commonly used antiemetics often do not help. Hot showers and baths as well as i.m. haloperidol (5\u202fmg) can provide acute relief from severe vomiting. Rubbing the abdomen with 0.075-0.1% capsaicin cream also has an antiemetic effect but less quickly. DISCUSSION: In ROME-IV the CHS is nosologically considered a\u00a0special variant of CVS. In particular, it is a\u00a0specific cannabis-related, often severe physical disorder. As healing can only be achieved through sustained cannabis abstinence, suspected CHS in emergency departments is an interdisciplinary challenge for gastroenterology, neuropsychiatry and the addiction support system.",

    "abstract": "Cannabis use is increasingly prevalent among individuals with epilepsy, yet its impact on seizure control remains poorly understood. While cannabidiol (CBD) has demonstrated antiseizure properties and gained FDA approval for specific epileptic syndromes, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive compound in cannabis, may alter neuronal excitability and potentially exacerbate seizure activity. We present two illustrative case reports of male patients with focal epilepsy and chronic cannabis use who underwent treatment with antiseizure medications and responsive neurostimulation (RNS). In both cases, cannabis use was temporally associated with breakthrough seizures and poor seizure control. These cases highlight the complex and multifactorial relationship between cannabis use and seizure outcomes, including potential pharmacokinetic interactions with antiseizure medications (ASM) and the possibility that cannabis may blunt the neuromodulation effects of RNS. Given the retrospective data and limited detail on cannabis use, these findings should be interpreted with caution. As cannabis use rises among individuals with epilepsy, further research is needed to clarify its potential effects on seizures and treatment response, including neuromodulation.",

    "title": "Evaluating Household Income and Tobacco Exposure as Moderators of the Association Between Prenatal Cannabis Exposure and Newborn Neurobehavior.",
    "abstract": "Prevalence rates for substance exposure during pregnancy are increasing, with cannabis emerging as one of the most common substances used. Infants with prenatal cannabis exposure face a greater risk of neurobehavioral vulnerabilities. The current study sought to examine the association between prenatal cannabis exposure and newborn neurobehavior, while also considering potential moderators (i.e., tobacco exposure and household income). The study included 115 pregnant individuals and their newborns enrolled in the Atlanta African American Maternal-Child cohort. Researchers quantitatively measured biomarkers of cannabis (COOH-THC) and tobacco smoke (COT) in urine samples collected at enrollment. Self-reported substance use was also collected during the first trimester of pregnancy. Newborn neurobehavior was assessed at 1\u00a0month of age (M\u00a0=\u00a025.3 days' old, SD\u00a0=\u00a014.41) using the NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scale. There were no significant main effects of self-reported prenatal cannabis use or prenatal COOH-THC concentrations on newborn neurobehavior. Additionally, tobacco exposure did not moderate these associations. Significant interactions were found between household income and prenatal COOH-THC levels in predicting newborn attention and arousal. Specifically, cannabis-exposed newborns exhibited attenuated attention and heightened arousal if they were from low-income households. Our findings highlight the potential role that socioeconomic factors may play in influencing behavior associated with prenatal exposures.",

    "title": "Association of Smoking Cannabis With Cardiovascular Events Among Veterans With Coronary Artery Disease.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Whether cannabis is a risk factor for cardiovascular events is unknown. We examined the association between smoking cannabis and cardiovascular events in a cohort of older veterans (66 to 68 years of age) with coronary artery disease. METHODS: The THC Cohort (Heart and Cannabis) comprised 4285 veterans (mean [SD] age, 67.5 [1.01] years; 2% female) with coronary artery disease who were born in 1950 to 1952. Participants were recruited between April 5, 2018, and March 12, 2020, interviewed about health behaviors, and then classified according to their self-reported cannabis smoking status in the previous 30 days. In a separate analysis, we classified participants according to any form of cannabis use (smoking, vaping, or edible use) versus nonuse in the past 30 days. Data on demographic, behavioral, and clinical characteristics were collected by telephone interview and from national Department of Veterans Affairs and Medicare data sources. The primary outcome included a composite of fatal and nonfatal stroke, fatal and nonfatal acute myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular death. The follow-up period for each patient extended from the date of their initial interview until the end of study (June 14, 2022). All participants were followed until they experienced an outcome or until the end of the follow-up period. Survey nonresponse weights and propensity score-based weights were used to reduce bias and confounding. Hazard ratios were estimated using cause-specific hazard models. RESULTS: The cohort included 1015 veterans with coronary artery disease who reported smoking cannabis in the previous 30 days and 3122 veterans who did not smoke cannabis in the previous 30 days. Mean follow-up was 3.3 years, and 563 events occurred. Compared with veterans who did not smoke cannabis, smoking cannabis (past 30 days) was not associated with the composite outcome of acute myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.61-1.24]). Similarly, use of any form of cannabis (smoking, vaping, dabbing, edibles) in the past 30 days was not associated with the composite outcome. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of older veterans with coronary artery disease, self-reported cannabis use was not independently associated with increased cardiovascular events over a mean of 3.3 years of follow-up.",

    "abstract": "Despite the widespread use of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) as the gold standard for dopamine (DA) replacement in Parkinson's Disease (PD), its prolonged administration frequently leads to L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID), a significant therapeutic challenge. Modulating the endocannabinoid system has emerged as a promising approach for managing LID. This study explored whether cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive compound of Cannabis sativa, and PECS-101, a fluorinated derivative of CBD, could mitigate the onset and progression of LID. We used unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats, treated with L-DOPA (10\u202fmg\u202fkg\u202f-\u202f1) for three weeks to induce severe abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs). Treatments were administered during the final two weeks. CBD (30\u202fmg\u202fkg\u202f-\u202f1) and PECS-101 (3 and 30\u202fmg\u202fkg\u202f-\u202f1) significantly reduced AIMs without impairing the motor benefits of L-DOPA. The antidyskinetic effects of CBD were associated with decreased striatal Fos-B and phospho-ERK expression and were independent of lesion severity. CBD effects were prevented by antagonists of CB1 (1\u202fmg\u202fkg\u202f-\u202f1) and PPAR\u03b3 (4\u202fmg\u202fkg\u202f-\u202f1) receptors. Co-administration of TRPV-1 antagonist capsazepine (5\u202fmg\u202fkg\u202f-\u202f1) enhanced the antidyskinetic effects of CBD. Combining the capsazepine with the neuronal nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, 7-nitroimidazole (10\u202fmg\u202fkg\u202f-\u202f1) enhanced these effects. CBD did not alter striatal DA levels but significantly increased the concentrations of anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol in dyskinetic animals. The antidyskinetic effects of CBD were associated with a reduction of the enhanced striatal glia and peripheral inflammation markers. These findings suggest that CBD alleviates LID by interacting with the nitrergic neurotransmission and TRPV-1, CB1, and PPAR\u03b3 receptors.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Polysubstance use-use of more than one substance- is prevalent and an emergent public health issue. Yet not much is known about factors associated with same-day polysubstance use among adolescents. This study examined correlates of same-day tobacco and cannabis use/co-use among adolescents who use tobacco/cannabis. METHODS: Cross-sectional data were from 10th and 11th grade students (n=536) who reported tobacco/cannabis use. Regression models were used to examine intrapersonal, psychological (anxiety, depression), societal (societal concern, discrimination), and environmental (public and home secondhand smoke/vape exposure) correlates of past 30-day usage frequency (no, infrequent, and frequent use) of same-day: poly-product use (poly-tobacco/nicotine [use of different types of nicotine/tobacco]; poly-cannabis [use of different types of or marijuana/THC]); poly-drug use [tobacco/nicotine and marijuana/THC], and nicotine and THC vape mixing. RESULTS: Participants were predominantly Hispanic (66.23%) and male (62.50%). Among participants, 8.58%, reported frequent same-day poly-tobacco use, 13.81% frequent same-day poly-cannabis use, 13.25% frequent same-day poly-drug use, and 3.36% vape mixing. Past 30-day alcohol use was associated with higher odds (1.88-8.31, p<.05) of infrequent and frequent same day use of all study outcomes except vape mixing. Secondhand smoke/vapor exposure was consistently associated with higher odds (1.13-1.26, p<.05) of infrequent/frequent same day use. Discrimination increased the odds of some same-day polysubstance use while societal concerns had inconsistent effects across study outcomes. CONCLUSION: A significant proportion of adolescents who use tobacco/cannabis products might engage in high-risk use patterns. Alcohol use, societal, and environmental factors significantly increase the likelihood of same-day poly-use of tobacco and cannabis products.",

    "title": "Synaptic signatures of perinatal cannabinoids: A systematic review of rodent hippocampal synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory.",
    "abstract": "The expanding legalization of cannabis raises significant public health concerns about its use during pregnancy, particularly due to the limited understanding of its impact on neurodevelopment. Existing research suggests that perinatal cannabis or cannabinoid exposure may impair learning and memory; however, variations in study design hinder the ability to draw generalizable conclusions. Clinical studies are limited in their observational nature and the lack of insight into neural or cellular mechanisms underlying cognitive changes, underscoring the importance of preclinical studies to explore the effects of perinatal cannabinoids in greater detail. The objective of this systematic review is to consolidate findings from existing preclinical research that investigates the effects of perinatal cannabinoid exposure on learning and memory and the putative mechanism of learning and memory, hippocampal synaptic plasticity, in rodents. This review summarizes studies on hippocampal synaptic plasticity (n\u2009=\u20092), spatial/visual memory (n\u2009=\u200913), working memory (n\u2009=\u20096), recognition memory (n\u2009=\u200912), and associative memory (n\u2009=\u20097). Perinatal cannabinoid-induced impairments were reported in the two synaptic plasticity studies, and in 24 out of 30 studies that examined learning and memory, with spatial memory tasks showing the most consistent deficits. While the existing evidence converges on the notion that perinatal cannabinoid exposure negatively impacts hippocampal physiology and associated memory functions, further research is needed to disentangle the influence of various methodological factors, including offspring sex and age, cannabinoid type, time of gestational exposure, and method of administration.",
