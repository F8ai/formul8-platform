      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use is prevalent among young adults, yet cessation treatment options are limited and underutilized. METHODS: Wisconsin residents aged 18 to 24 who had vaped nicotine in the past month (N\u2009=\u2009480) completed an online survey assessing vaping initiation, past quit experiences, future quit intentions, and treatment knowledge and preferences. The survey also assessed perceived physical and mental health harms of vaping nicotine and other products (eg, cannabis, cannabidiol). RESULTS: Most young adults had made a prior e-cigarette quit attempt, commonly motivated by concerns about addiction, cost, and health problems. Though 80% want support to quit, preferred methods of support were highly variable. The same methods (eg, medication, friends/family, health care provider, therapist) that were most endorsed as the form of support young adults were most likely to use were also among the most endorsed forms of support that young adults would not want to use. Nearly 40% of participants reported vaping cannabis and perceived vaping cannabis as significantly less harmful than vaping nicotine or tobacco for physical and mental health. CONCLUSIONS: Vaping cessation resources that are responsive to young adults' needs and preferences are needed. The high variability in treatment preferences suggests that multiple strategies need to be offered; there is no one-size-fits-all approach. Cannabis vaping is prevalent, and an important area for future research is to examine the impact of cannabis vaping on nicotine vaping dependence, cessation, and treatment use. Strategies to reach, motivate, and engage young adults in e-cigarette cessation and cessation treatment should highlight their concerns about addiction, costs, health harms, and desired treatment options.",

      "title": "[The cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome-A narrative review].",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Until 25\u00a0years ago cyclic vomiting attacks under the chronic influence of cannabis were virtually unknown. Following the legalization of non-medical cannabis in North America and the associated increase in cannabis use, including high-potency strains, the number of patients there with cannabis-related cyclic vomiting is increasing. The ROME-IV criteria now define cannabis-induced cyclic vomiting as cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS). This review aims to provide information about CHS, as an increase in cases is also to be expected in Germany following legalization. METHOD: Selective review article. RESULTS: The CHS is most frequently registered in emergency departments. A\u00a0clear differentiation between CHS and cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS), in which one third of those affected also regularly use cannabis, is only possible by establishing full remission during a\u00a06-12\u00a0month cannabis abstinence. Therefore, mixed forms of CVS and CHS are initially seen in emergency departments (suspected CHS), also with hidden life-threatening abdominal comorbidities. Severe vomiting can also lead to serious complications. The commonly used antiemetics often do not help. Hot showers and baths as well as i.m. haloperidol (5\u202fmg) can provide acute relief from severe vomiting. Rubbing the abdomen with 0.075-0.1% capsaicin cream also has an antiemetic effect but less quickly. DISCUSSION: In ROME-IV the CHS is nosologically considered a\u00a0special variant of CVS. In particular, it is a\u00a0specific cannabis-related, often severe physical disorder. As healing can only be achieved through sustained cannabis abstinence, suspected CHS in emergency departments is an interdisciplinary challenge for gastroenterology, neuropsychiatry and the addiction support system.",

      "abstract": "Cannabis use is increasingly prevalent among individuals with epilepsy, yet its impact on seizure control remains poorly understood. While cannabidiol (CBD) has demonstrated antiseizure properties and gained FDA approval for specific epileptic syndromes, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive compound in cannabis, may alter neuronal excitability and potentially exacerbate seizure activity. We present two illustrative case reports of male patients with focal epilepsy and chronic cannabis use who underwent treatment with antiseizure medications and responsive neurostimulation (RNS). In both cases, cannabis use was temporally associated with breakthrough seizures and poor seizure control. These cases highlight the complex and multifactorial relationship between cannabis use and seizure outcomes, including potential pharmacokinetic interactions with antiseizure medications (ASM) and the possibility that cannabis may blunt the neuromodulation effects of RNS. Given the retrospective data and limited detail on cannabis use, these findings should be interpreted with caution. As cannabis use rises among individuals with epilepsy, further research is needed to clarify its potential effects on seizures and treatment response, including neuromodulation.",

This study investigates the perceptions, consumption patterns, and reported outcomes of cannabis and cannabidiol (CBD) oil use among IBD patients and controls. METHODS: A 37-question survey was administered to 139 participants (IBD patients,  RESULTS: Cannabis consumption was higher in IBD patients (57, 53.8%) than controls (15, 45.5%) with both groups strongly supporting medical cannabis use (IBD; 92, 86.8% vs. controls; 29, 84.9%). Most IBD patients believed cannabis (67, 63.2%), CBD oil (60, 56.6%), corticosteroids (77, 73.3%), and biologics/immunosuppressants (85, 81.0%) had a somewhat-extremely beneficial effect in relieving IBD symptoms. Over 50% of IBD cannabis users reported relief from abdominal pain, other pain, stress, anxiety, depression, and nausea/vomiting, with Crohn's disease patients experiencing significantly more relief than ulcerative colitis patients for certain symptoms ( CONCLUSIONS: Consumption of cannabis and CBD oil was perceived as beneficial for relieving IBD, with many reporting significant symptom relief from using these substances. The strong support of cannabis and CBD oil as medical treatments and therapeutic effects highlights the potential for cannabis and CBD oil as treatments in IBD.",

      "abstract": "Prevalence rates for substance exposure during pregnancy are increasing, with cannabis emerging as one of the most common substances used. Infants with prenatal cannabis exposure face a greater risk of neurobehavioral vulnerabilities. The current study sought to examine the association between prenatal cannabis exposure and newborn neurobehavior, while also considering potential moderators (i.e., tobacco exposure and household income). The study included 115 pregnant individuals and their newborns enrolled in the Atlanta African American Maternal-Child cohort. Researchers quantitatively measured biomarkers of cannabis (COOH-THC) and tobacco smoke (COT) in urine samples collected at enrollment. Self-reported substance use was also collected during the first trimester of pregnancy. Newborn neurobehavior was assessed at 1\u00a0month of age (M\u00a0=\u00a025.3 days' old, SD\u00a0=\u00a014.41) using the NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scale. There were no significant main effects of self-reported prenatal cannabis use or prenatal COOH-THC concentrations on newborn neurobehavior. Additionally, tobacco exposure did not moderate these associations. Significant interactions were found between household income and prenatal COOH-THC levels in predicting newborn attention and arousal. Specifically, cannabis-exposed newborns exhibited attenuated attention and heightened arousal if they were from low-income households. Our findings highlight the potential role that socioeconomic factors may play in influencing behavior associated with prenatal exposures.",

      "title": "Association of Smoking Cannabis With Cardiovascular Events Among Veterans With Coronary Artery Disease.",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Whether cannabis is a risk factor for cardiovascular events is unknown. We examined the association between smoking cannabis and cardiovascular events in a cohort of older veterans (66 to 68 years of age) with coronary artery disease. METHODS: The THC Cohort (Heart and Cannabis) comprised 4285 veterans (mean [SD] age, 67.5 [1.01] years; 2% female) with coronary artery disease who were born in 1950 to 1952. Participants were recruited between April 5, 2018, and March 12, 2020, interviewed about health behaviors, and then classified according to their self-reported cannabis smoking status in the previous 30 days. In a separate analysis, we classified participants according to any form of cannabis use (smoking, vaping, or edible use) versus nonuse in the past 30 days. Data on demographic, behavioral, and clinical characteristics were collected by telephone interview and from national Department of Veterans Affairs and Medicare data sources. The primary outcome included a composite of fatal and nonfatal stroke, fatal and nonfatal acute myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular death. The follow-up period for each patient extended from the date of their initial interview until the end of study (June 14, 2022). All participants were followed until they experienced an outcome or until the end of the follow-up period. Survey nonresponse weights and propensity score-based weights were used to reduce bias and confounding. Hazard ratios were estimated using cause-specific hazard models. RESULTS: The cohort included 1015 veterans with coronary artery disease who reported smoking cannabis in the previous 30 days and 3122 veterans who did not smoke cannabis in the previous 30 days. Mean follow-up was 3.3 years, and 563 events occurred. Compared with veterans who did not smoke cannabis, smoking cannabis (past 30 days) was not associated with the composite outcome of acute myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.61-1.24]). Similarly, use of any form of cannabis (smoking, vaping, dabbing, edibles) in the past 30 days was not associated with the composite outcome. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of older veterans with coronary artery disease, self-reported cannabis use was not independently associated with increased cardiovascular events over a mean of 3.3 years of follow-up.",

      "abstract": "Despite the widespread use of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) as the gold standard for dopamine (DA) replacement in Parkinson's Disease (PD), its prolonged administration frequently leads to L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID), a significant therapeutic challenge. Modulating the endocannabinoid system has emerged as a promising approach for managing LID. This study explored whether cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive compound of Cannabis sativa, and PECS-101, a fluorinated derivative of CBD, could mitigate the onset and progression of LID. We used unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats, treated with L-DOPA (10\u202fmg\u202fkg\u202f-\u202f1) for three weeks to induce severe abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs). Treatments were administered during the final two weeks. CBD (30\u202fmg\u202fkg\u202f-\u202f1) and PECS-101 (3 and 30\u202fmg\u202fkg\u202f-\u202f1) significantly reduced AIMs without impairing the motor benefits of L-DOPA. The antidyskinetic effects of CBD were associated with decreased striatal Fos-B and phospho-ERK expression and were independent of lesion severity. CBD effects were prevented by antagonists of CB1 (1\u202fmg\u202fkg\u202f-\u202f1) and PPAR\u03b3 (4\u202fmg\u202fkg\u202f-\u202f1) receptors. Co-administration of TRPV-1 antagonist capsazepine (5\u202fmg\u202fkg\u202f-\u202f1) enhanced the antidyskinetic effects of CBD. Combining the capsazepine with the neuronal nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, 7-nitroimidazole (10\u202fmg\u202fkg\u202f-\u202f1) enhanced these effects. CBD did not alter striatal DA levels but significantly increased the concentrations of anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol in dyskinetic animals. The antidyskinetic effects of CBD were associated with a reduction of the enhanced striatal glia and peripheral inflammation markers. These findings suggest that CBD alleviates LID by interacting with the nitrergic neurotransmission and TRPV-1, CB1, and PPAR\u03b3 receptors.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Polysubstance use-use of more than one substance- is prevalent and an emergent public health issue. Yet not much is known about factors associated with same-day polysubstance use among adolescents. This study examined correlates of same-day tobacco and cannabis use/co-use among adolescents who use tobacco/cannabis. METHODS: Cross-sectional data were from 10th and 11th grade students (n=536) who reported tobacco/cannabis use. Regression models were used to examine intrapersonal, psychological (anxiety, depression), societal (societal concern, discrimination), and environmental (public and home secondhand smoke/vape exposure) correlates of past 30-day usage frequency (no, infrequent, and frequent use) of same-day: poly-product use (poly-tobacco/nicotine [use of different types of nicotine/tobacco]; poly-cannabis [use of different types of or marijuana/THC]); poly-drug use [tobacco/nicotine and marijuana/THC], and nicotine and THC vape mixing. RESULTS: Participants were predominantly Hispanic (66.23%) and male (62.50%). Among participants, 8.58%, reported frequent same-day poly-tobacco use, 13.81% frequent same-day poly-cannabis use, 13.25% frequent same-day poly-drug use, and 3.36% vape mixing. Past 30-day alcohol use was associated with higher odds (1.88-8.31, p<.05) of infrequent and frequent same day use of all study outcomes except vape mixing. Secondhand smoke/vapor exposure was consistently associated with higher odds (1.13-1.26, p<.05) of infrequent/frequent same day use. Discrimination increased the odds of some same-day polysubstance use while societal concerns had inconsistent effects across study outcomes. CONCLUSION: A significant proportion of adolescents who use tobacco/cannabis products might engage in high-risk use patterns. Alcohol use, societal, and environmental factors significantly increase the likelihood of same-day poly-use of tobacco and cannabis products.",

      "title": "Synaptic signatures of perinatal cannabinoids: A systematic review of rodent hippocampal synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory.",
      "abstract": "The expanding legalization of cannabis raises significant public health concerns about its use during pregnancy, particularly due to the limited understanding of its impact on neurodevelopment. Existing research suggests that perinatal cannabis or cannabinoid exposure may impair learning and memory; however, variations in study design hinder the ability to draw generalizable conclusions. Clinical studies are limited in their observational nature and the lack of insight into neural or cellular mechanisms underlying cognitive changes, underscoring the importance of preclinical studies to explore the effects of perinatal cannabinoids in greater detail. The objective of this systematic review is to consolidate findings from existing preclinical research that investigates the effects of perinatal cannabinoid exposure on learning and memory and the putative mechanism of learning and memory, hippocampal synaptic plasticity, in rodents. This review summarizes studies on hippocampal synaptic plasticity (n\u2009=\u20092), spatial/visual memory (n\u2009=\u200913), working memory (n\u2009=\u20096), recognition memory (n\u2009=\u200912), and associative memory (n\u2009=\u20097). Perinatal cannabinoid-induced impairments were reported in the two synaptic plasticity studies, and in 24 out of 30 studies that examined learning and memory, with spatial memory tasks showing the most consistent deficits. While the existing evidence converges on the notion that perinatal cannabinoid exposure negatively impacts hippocampal physiology and associated memory functions, further research is needed to disentangle the influence of various methodological factors, including offspring sex and age, cannabinoid type, time of gestational exposure, and method of administration.",

      "abstract": "Inhibition of melanogenesis is of major interest in the cosmetic industry. The mechanism underlying melanogenesis includes regulating tyrosinase by activating various signaling pathways, such as protein kinase A and C pathways. Natural material-based agents have recently gained attention as alternative medicines to suppress melanogenic pathways. Cannabis sativa contains many bioactive compounds that are widely used in traditional herbal medicines. The aim of this study was to identify and assess the anti-melanogenic effect of terpene extract from Cannabis sativa flower (TCF) to explore novel depigmenting agents. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed that TCF contains five monoterpenes, eleven sesquiterpenes, and a diterpene. MTT and melanin content assays demonstrated that TCF significantly decreased the melanin content per live cell in a dose-dependent manner. Tyrosinase inhibition assay showed that TCF exhibited little inhibitory effect on tyrosinase at an equal dose, which reduced the melanin content. However, western blot analysis revealed that TCF downregulated microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), and tyrosinase-related proteins TRP1, and TRP2 expression by suppressing PKC, p38, and ERK/STAT3, while upregulated Akt pathway in melan-a. These results highlight the potential application of TCF as a natural whitening agent in the cosmetics industry.",

      "title": "Effects of five cannabis oils with different CBD: THC ratios and terpenes on hypertension, dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis, oxidative stress, and CB1 receptor in an experimental model.",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common liver disorder caused by oxidative stress and dysregulation of lipid metabolism. The endocannabinoid system (ECS), particularly the type 1 cannabinoid (CB1) receptor, plays a crucial role in NAFLD progression. Cannabinoids, such as cannabidiol (CBD) and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), along with terpenes, such as beta-myrcene and d-limonene, have shown potential therapeutic effects on liver health, particularly in reducing oxidative stress and modulating lipid metabolism. This study aimed to analyse the effects of five cannabis oils (COs), each with different CBD:THC ratios and terpenes content, on hypertension, dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis, oxidative stress, and CB1 receptor expression in an experimental model of NAFLD induced by a sucrose-rich diet (SRD) in Wistar rats for 3 weeks. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were fed either a: (1) reference diet (RD; standard commercial laboratory diet) or a: (2) sucrose-rich diet (SRD) for 3 weeks. 3 to 7 SRD\u2009+\u2009CO as following: (3) SRD\u2009+\u2009THC; (4) SRD\u2009+\u2009CBD; (5) SRD\u2009+\u2009CBD:THC 1:1; (6) SRD\u2009+\u2009CBD:THC 2:1; and (7) SRD\u2009+\u2009CBD:THC 3:1. The COs were administered orally at a dose of 1.5\u00a0mg total cannabinoids/kg body weight daily. The cannabinoid and terpenes content of all COs used in the study was determined. The terpenes found in COs were beta-myrcene, d-limonene, terpinolene, linalool, beta-caryophyllene, alpha-humulene, (-)-guaiol, (-)-alpha-bisabolol. During the experimental period, body weight, food intake and blood pressure were measured. Serum glucose, triglyceride, total cholesterol, uric acid, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (AP) levels were evaluated. Liver tissue histology, NAFLD activity score (NAS), triglyceride and cholesterol content, lipogenic enzyme activities, enzyme related to mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, reactive oxygen species (ROS), thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS), and antioxidant enzyme activities were also evaluated. The CB1 receptor expression was also determined. RESULTS: The results showed that SRD-fed rats developed hypertension, dyslipidemia, liver damage, hepatic steatosis, lipid peroxidation, and oxidative stress. This was accompanied by upregulation of liver CB1 receptor expression. CBD-rich CO, CBD:THC 1:1 ratio CO; CBD:THC 2:1 ratio CO and CBD:THC 3:1 ratio CO showed antihypertensive properties. THC-rich CO, CBD:THC 1:1 ratio CO; CBD:THC 2:1 ratio CO showed the greatest beneficial effects against hepatic steatosis and liver damage. All COs exhibited antioxidant effects in liver tissue. This was associated with normal liver CB1 receptor expression. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that COs, particularly THC-rich CO, CBD:THC ratio 1:1 CO, CBD:THC ratio 2:1 CO and terpenes, can effectively reduce dyslipidemia, liver damage and hepatic steatosis in SRD-induced NAFLD. COs with a higher proportion of CBD in their composition showed antihypertensive properties. All the COs exhibited antioxidant properties. These findings suggest that COs, especially those with CBD:THC ratios of 1:1 and 2:1 and terpenes, may represent a promising therapeutic approach for managing NAFLD and preventing its progression to more severe liver disease.",

      "abstract": "Terpenes are the largest and most diverse class of natural products, essential for plant defence, ecological interactions, and environmental adaptation. Cannabis sativa is noted for its rich terpene profile, influencing aroma, flavour, and pharmacological properties. Limonene, a significant monoterpene, is commercially important in the fragrance and flavouring industries, making it a target for metabolic engineering. Terpene biosynthesis involves terpene synthase enzymes that convert isoprenoid diphosphates into diverse terpene scaffolds. Despite advances in terpene biochemistry, C. sativa TPSs lack structural characterisation. This study presents the first crystal structure of (-)-limonene synthase from C. sativa, offering insights into monoterpene biosynthesis. Solved at 3.2\u00a0\u00c5 resolution, the structure shows an \"open\" conformation with a solvent-accessible active site and disordered loops near the catalytic pocket, indicating a pre-catalytic state that aids substrate access. Biochemical characterisation confirmed limonene synthase as a highly specific monoterpene synthase, predominantly producing (-)-limonene from geranyl diphosphate with minor amounts of eight other monoterpenes.

      "abstract": "Cannabis sativa L. constituents, such as cannabinoids, terpenes, flavonoids, and other secondary metabolites, determine the plant's (medicinal) effects and properties in a complex interplay, a phenomenon known as the entourage effect. However, environmental influences like cultivation method, soil, light, and climate might also influence the plant's chemical composition-and thus its therapeutic profile. Much like in viticulture, the concept of a \"cannabis terroir\" might play an important role in determining the plant's chemical phenotype. The aim of this study was therefore to make these complex properties analytically accessible and develop a comprehensive metabolomics workflow using gas chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (GC-HRMS) and liquid chromatography-high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS/MS) in positive and negative ionization mode, applying HILIC and reversed phase chromatography to assess multiple chemical classes. Data processing and statistical analysis were done in MS-DIAL and MetaboAnalyst, respectively. The method was applied to 35 CBD-type cannabis flowers grown under different environmental conditions, and compounds belonging to various chemical classes were successfully detected. Principal component analysis revealed distinct clustering of the samples, and key discriminative features were identified, including cannabinoids, terpenes such as \u03b2-caryophyllene and \u03b1-humulene, cuticular alkanes (e.g., pentacosane and nonacosane), and polar compounds such as choline and trigonelline. The markers enabled a discrimination of samples not only by chemical phenotype but also by cultivation environment, supporting the emerging concept of a cannabis terroir. In conclusion, this study introduces an analytical framework for the comprehensive chemical profiling of cannabis employing GC-HRMS and LC-HRMS analysis and advanced statistical techniques.",

METHODS: Eleven female participants (5-16\u2009years) with a pathogenic variant in the MECP2 gene were recruited to this study, receiving NTI164 twice daily for 12\u2009weeks. The primary outcome measure was the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) Scale, with secondary outcomes measured using the CGI-Severity (CGI-S), RTT Behaviour Questionnaire (RSBQ), RTT-Symptom Index Score (RTT-SIS), RTT-Domain-Specific Concerns-Visual-Analog Scale (RTT-DSC-VAS), Impact of Childhood Neurological Disability/Quality of Life (ICND+QoL), and RTT-Caregiver Burden Inventory (RTT-CBI). Paired-samples t-test was used to assess significance between baseline and Week 12. RESULTS: Improvements were seen in the total CGI-I score (p\u2009=\u20090.028), with improvements in communication skills (p\u2009=\u20090.003), mental alertness (p\u2009=\u20090.033), socialisation/eye contact (p\u2009=\u20090.0004), attentiveness (p\u2009=\u20090.001), and anxiety (p\u2009=\u20090.004). CGI-S also demonstrated better outcomes after NTI164 administration (p\u2009=\u20090.008). RSBQ showed improvements in total score (p\u2009=\u20090.0005), general mood (p\u2009=\u20090.0003), breathing problems (p\u2009=\u20090.041), repetitive face movements (p\u2009=\u20090.004), and fear/anxiety (p\u2009=\u20090.006). RTT-DSC-VAS showed positive developments in abilities to communicate choices (p\u2009=\u20090.041). ICND total score was improved (p\u2009=\u20090.003), as well as cognition (p\u2009=\u20090.027) and Quality of Life (p\u2009=\u20090.0002). Total score on the RTT-CBI was improved (p\u2009=\u20090.006). CONCLUSION: NTI164 demonstrated safety and improved some clinical and functional outcomes in RTT. These improvements justify ongoing research into NTI164, which may be a potential adjunct therapy in RTT.",

      "abstract": "Cannabis sativa is a high-value plant renowned for its diverse chemical composition and abundant terpene content, contributing to its unique aroma, flavour, and therapeutic effects. Terpenes significantly influence consumer preference for C. sativa products, driving scientific interest in optimising terpene expression profiles and shaping the selective breeding of terpene profiles in C. sativa cultivars. In particular, the monoterpene, terpinolene, is influential in defining the sensory and therapeutic qualities of many C. sativa strains due to its woody, citrus-like aroma. Here we report the 2.5 \u00c5 resolution crystal structure of terpinolene synthase (CsTOS) from C. sativa in its apo form. The structure exhibits the class I monoterpene synthase fold with an open active site conformation. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we identified H618 as a key residues in determining product specificity. Substituting H618 with charged residues resulted in the preferential formation of limonene over terpinolene, highlighting its critical role in stabilising the substrate intermediate. Additionally, novel mutations uncovered an extended epistatic network of residues within 5 \u00c5 of the active site, spanning the \u03b1-helical bundle of the terpene synthase fold. These interactions contribute to monoterpene formation by modulating substrate positioning and catalytic activity. These insights advance our understanding of monoterpene biosynthesis and enable the targeted engineering of terpene synthases for customised terpene production, offering significant potential for the C. sativa industry.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This review article addresses the vaping chemistry of manufactured cannabis concentrates-a topic that remains under-researched despite the widespread availability and growing popularity of these products. Given their current prevalence and the fact that many of the findings discussed herein are from early-stage investigations, further research is essential to fully assess the public health risks associated with concentrate use. The purpose of this article is to help begin to bridge this knowledge gap by outlining the technical challenges of studying cannabis concentrates and to present evidence-based data concerning toxicant exposures as a foundation for future investigations. METHODS: A search of cannabis concentrate vaping within the date range of 2019-2025 on Google Scholar returned approximately 2,700 hits. A cannabis concentrate was defined as a sample containing at least 50% (w/w) cannabinoids. In addition to our group's articles, the search results contained six manuscripts that described at least a partial focus on molecular emissions specifically derived from vaping or dabbing samples that included cannabis concentrates. FINDINGS: Studying cannabis concentrate vaping poses distinct technical challenges that differ from those associated with electronic nicotine delivery systems. Emissions from vaping concentrates contain a substantial proportion of harmful aerosol toxicants, including isoprene, 3-methylcrotonaldehyde, 3-methyl-1-butene, and 2-methyl-2-butene. Moreover, some concentrate formulations have contained hazardous additives such as pine rosin and ketene precursors such as cannabinoid acetates. As with nicotine vaping, the presence of oxygen plays a critical role in driving the formation of many toxic chemical degradation products during vaping. CONCLUSION: Since the legalization of recreational cannabis, concentrates have become one of the most rapidly expanding segments of the U.S. cannabis market. However, research into the specific health risks of vaping these products has significantly lagged their widespread use. The studies presented in this review article highlight the potential for exposure to known toxicants during the vaping of cannabis concentrates.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This review article addresses the vaping chemistry of manufactured cannabis concentrates-a topic that remains under-researched despite the widespread availability and growing popularity of these products. Given their current prevalence and the fact that many of the findings discussed herein are from early-stage investigations, further research is essential to fully assess the public health risks associated with concentrate use. The purpose of this article is to help begin to bridge this knowledge gap by outlining the technical challenges of studying cannabis concentrates and to present evidence-based data concerning toxicant exposures as a foundation for future investigations. METHODS: A search of cannabis concentrate vaping within the date range of 2019-2025 on Google Scholar returned approximately 2,700 hits. A cannabis concentrate was defined as a sample containing at least 50% (w/w) cannabinoids. In addition to our group's articles, the search results contained six manuscripts that described at least a partial focus on molecular emissions specifically derived from vaping or dabbing samples that included cannabis concentrates. FINDINGS: Studying cannabis concentrate vaping poses distinct technical challenges that differ from those associated with electronic nicotine delivery systems. Emissions from vaping concentrates contain a substantial proportion of harmful aerosol toxicants, including isoprene, 3-methylcrotonaldehyde, 3-methyl-1-butene, and 2-methyl-2-butene. Moreover, some concentrate formulations have contained hazardous additives such as pine rosin and ketene precursors such as cannabinoid acetates. As with nicotine vaping, the presence of oxygen plays a critical role in driving the formation of many toxic chemical degradation products during vaping. CONCLUSION: Since the legalization of recreational cannabis, concentrates have become one of the most rapidly expanding segments of the U.S. cannabis market. However, research into the specific health risks of vaping these products has significantly lagged their widespread use. The studies presented in this review article highlight the potential for exposure to known toxicants during the vaping of cannabis concentrates.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Terpenes, which are found in high concentrations in the essential oil fraction of the Cannabis sativa flower, have demonstrated potential in many therapeutic and industrial applications. OBJECTIVES: This work reports on a method developed for quantifying 18 terpenes in C. sativa essential oil obtained through hydrodistillation. The following method has been evaluated for specificity, selectivity, accuracy, linearity, precision, stability, limit of detection, and limit of quantification. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Samples were prepared by separating the essential oil fraction through hydrodistillation and then diluting with ethyl acetate containing a 100\u2009\u03bcg/mL solution of n-tridecane and octadecane as internal standards. Analysis was performed on a gas chromatograph mass spectrometer (GCMS) using selected ion monitoring (SIM). RESULTS: The developed method enabled quantification of isomers of nerolidol and ocimene and several coeluting compounds, with recoveries of 87.35%-116.61%. Two cultivars of C. sativa flower were evaluated, and the dominant terpene compounds in both cultivars were \u03b2-myrcene (5.85-8.62\u2009mg/g dried plant) and \u03b2-caryophyllene (3.89-4.69\u2009mg/g), followed by \u03b1-humulene (1.35-1.99\u2009mg/g), limonene (0.91-1.33\u2009mg/g), and \u03b1-bisabolol (0.66-0.68\u2009mg/g). CONCLUSION: This method provides an accurate and reliable procedure for separating and quantifying the major terpene compounds in C. sativa flower using hydrodistillation and GCMS with SIM. The simplicity and solvent-free nature of the hydrodistillation extraction, combined with the specificity and accuracy of using SIM and external standards, enables the determination of total and individual terpenes concentrations within plant material and supports numerous industrial and therapeutic applications.",

This study aimed to investigate the antibacterial activity of ethanolic extracts from the stems and leaves of the Hang Kra Rog Phu Phan ST1 strain against twelve human pathogenic bacteria. &lt;b&gt;Materials and Methods:&lt;/b&gt; Stems and leaves from the Hang Kra Rog Phu Phan ST1 strain were subjected to ethanol extraction. The primary antibacterial activity of ethanolic extracts from Tanao Si Kan Dang RD1 was assessed using the disc diffusion method, while the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were determined via the broth microdilution method. The inhibition zone diameter (mm) was analyzed using Duncan's Multiple Range Test (DMRT) with the SAS software. &lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; The findings revealed that the ethanolic extract from the leaves of Hang Kra Rog Phu Phan ST1 produced the largest inhibition zone diameter of 10.00 mm against &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt; TISTR 008. The MIC and MBC of the leaf extract showed the lowest values of 0.09 and 0.19 mg/mL, respectively, recorded against &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; TISTR 1466. &lt;b&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/b&gt; This is the first report on the antibacterial activity of the ethanolic extracts from the leaves and stems of Hang Kra Rog Phu Phan ST1, which offers potential benefits for developing natural antibiotic drugs to combat infections caused by the tested pathogenic bacteria.",

      "abstract": "Increased acceptance of cannabis containing the psychoactive component, \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), raises concerns about the potential for impaired drivers and increased highway accidents. In contrast to the \"breathalyzer\" test, which is generally accepted for determining the alcohol level in a driver, there is no currently accepted roadside test for THC in a motorist. There is a need for an easily collectible biological sample from a potentially impaired driver coupled with an accurate on-site test to measure the presence and quantity of THC in a driver. A novel breath collection device is described, which includes three separate sample collectors for collecting identical A, B, and C breath samples from a subject. A simple one-step ethanol extraction of the \"A\" breath collector sample can be analyzed by UHPLC/selected ion monitoring (SIM) liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) to provide qualitative and quantitative determination of THC in breath sample in less than 4\u2009min for samples collected up to 6\u2009h after smoking a cannabis cigarette. SIM LC/MS bioanalyses employed d3-THC as the stable isotope internal standard fortified in negative control breath samples for quantitation including replicates of six calibrator standards and three quality control (QC) samples. Subsequent confirmation of the same breath sample in the B collectors was then confirmed by a reference lab by LC/MS/MS analysis. Fit-for-purpose bioanalytical validation consistent with pharmaceutical regulated bioanalyses produced pharmacokinetic (PK) curves for the two volunteer cannabis smokers. These results produced PK curves, which showed a rapid increase of THC in the breath of the subjects in the first hour followed by reduced THC levels in the later time points. A simpler single-point calibration curve procedure with calibrators and QC prepared in ethanol provided similar results. Limitations to this approach include the higher cost and operator skill sets for the instrumentation employed and the inability to actually determine driver impairment.",

      "abstract": "Shrimp aquaculture plays a crucial role in global food production but is increasingly threatened by viral and microsporidian pathogens such as White Spot Syndrome Virus (WSSV), Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei (EHP) and Infectious Hypodermal and Haematopoietic Necrosis Virus (IHHNV). Conventional reliance on antibiotics to combat these infections has raised serious concerns regarding antimicrobial resistance, environmental contamination and food safety. Additionally, environmental stressors such as salinity shifts and poor water quality exacerbate disease outbreaks, leading to severe production losses across Asia and Latin America. To explore eco-friendly therapeutic alternatives, this study assessed the antiviral potential of cannabidiol (CBD), a bioactive compound extracted from Cannabis sativa seed oil, identified through GC-MS analysis. Using molecular docking techniques, we evaluated CBD's interactions with key viral proteins: VP28 of WSSV, the tubulin \u03b2-chain of EHP and the capsid protein of IHHNV. The docking results revealed strong binding affinities of -6.61\u2009kcal/mol (EHP), -6.72\u2009kcal/mol (IHHNV) and -5.38\u2009kcal/mol (WSSV), indicating stable and potentially inhibitory interactions. Structural models were retrieved from RCSB PDB and SwissModel, while ligand preparation and docking were performed using AutoDock 4.2. CBD also demonstrated favourable pharmacokinetic and safety profiles, with predictions indicating no mutagenicity, hepatotoxicity or cardiotoxicity, and acceptable drug-likeness characteristics. Compared to other plant-derived compounds previously tested in shrimp disease models, CBD exhibited superior binding stability, more interaction residues and better bioavailability scores. These findings highlight CBD as a promising dual-function agent, capable of both modulating shrimp immunity and directly inhibiting key viral pathogens. These findings highlight cannabidiol (CBD) as a promising dual-action compound, with the potential to both enhance shrimp immune responses and exert direct antiviral effects against key pathogens. This study lays a robust groundwork for future in\u00a0vivo validations, formulation strategies and regulatory frameworks, ultimately supporting the development of sustainable, precision-based aquaculture health management.",

      "abstract": "Cannabidiol (CBD) is a phytocannabinoid which holds benefit for anxiety-related disorders. This study evaluated the effects of a lipid-based CBD nanoemulsion in anxiety- and panic-related responses. Male Wistar rats were acutely or chronically orally treated (21\u00a0days) with CBD (2.5 and 5\u00a0mg/kg, 1\u00a0mL/kg) or vehicle (1\u00a0mL/kg) and tested in the avoidance and escape tasks of the elevated T-maze (ETM) and in an open field. We quantified chronic CBD in the whole brain of the animals and evaluated FosB/deltaFosB immunoreactivity (Fos-ir) in non-serotonergic cells of the dorsal raphe (DR) and periaqueductal gray matter and in serotonergic cells of the DR. Acute CBD did not alter behavior. Chronic CBD 2.5\u00a0mg yielded (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SEM) 64.25\u00a0\u00b1\u00a028.82 and CBD 5.0\u00a0mg 21.22\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.46\u00a0ng of CBD/g of brain tissue. Chronic CBD 2.5\u00a0mg induced anxiolytic and panicolytic-like effects. Immunohistochemical results showed that chronic CBD significantly decreased Fos-ir in the lateral and dorsomedial periaqueductal gray and in the dorsal region (DRD) and ventrolateral periqueductal gray/lateral wings (lwDR) of the DR. Fos-ir in the dorsolateral periaqueductal gray was only decreased by CBD 2.5\u00a0mg. CBD increased tryptophan hydroxylase immunoreactivity in the lwDR and DRD. CBD 2.5\u00a0mg also increased tryptophan hydroxylase immunoreactivity in the ventral DR. Additionally, double immunostaining was increased in the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray/lwDR by CBD 2.5\u00a0mg. These results point to the anxiolytic- and panicolytic-like effects of a CBD lipid-based nanoemulsion and suggest that they may be related to the modulation of DR serotonin neurons.",

Cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive compound from Cannabis sativa, has shown anticancer properties. This review analyzes CBD's therapeutic potential in HCC, focusing on mechanisms, preclinical/clinical findings, and integration into treatment strategies. A systematic search (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar) up to March 2025 identified 16 relevant studies (in vitro, in vivo, clinical). CBD exerts antitumor effects via multiple pathways, including apoptosis, autophagy regulation, metastasis suppression, and tumor microenvironment modulation. CBD interacts with the endocannabinoid system (ECS), inhibits oncogenic signaling (PI3K/AKT/mTOR), and enhances chemotherapeutic efficacy (sorafenib, cabozantinib). Studies show CBD induces pyroptosis via caspase-3/GSDME, and modulates autophagy by inhibiting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. It also sensitizes HCC cells to sorafenib and cabozantinib. Preclinical results are promising, but clinical studies are limited. Challenges like bioavailability and potential hepatotoxicity require investigation. Future research should optimize formulations, determine dosing, and conduct clinical trials to validate CBD's efficacy/safety in HCC patients. Validated CBD could offer an innovative HCC management option.",

      "abstract": "Despite their growing popularity, cannabis vape products remain understudied. Cannabis vape cartridges are used with battery-powered devices that aerosolize cannabis flower extracts containing high concentrations of cannabinoids such as THC. These types of products are commonly known as cannabis distillates. The potency of these products presents challenges in establishing effective dosing for preclinical studies. Currently, there are no established, standardized preclinical models for testing the safety and efficacy of these products in ways analogous to human use patterns. Thus, the in vivo cannabis distillate exposure regime required to achieve physiologically relevant doses in comparison to what is achieved in humans remains undetermined. To address this gap, a standardized preclinical murine model for inhalation of vaporized cannabis distillates has been developed using a computer-controlled delivery system. This protocol details procedures to administer cannabis vape distillates using a regimented puff topography to mice by a nose-only exposure tower. Methods to monitor mouse behavioral outcomes post-exposure and the utilization of a semi-quantitative ELISA to confirm THC delivery into the systemic circulation are also provided. This protocol will allow for the investigation of the pulmonary and systemic responses to cannabis vape distillate products by researchers interested in exploring the impact of cannabis vaping using real-world delivery protocols, thereby providing an opportunity for rigorous safety and therapeutic evaluation.",

      "title": "Innovations in Cannabis Delivery Systems: A Patent Review (2012-2024).",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Cannabis sativa has been cultivated for over 11,700 years, originating in Central and Southeast Asia, and has been used for medical, recreational, and religious purposes. Among its therapeutic potentials, it is notable for its capacity to alleviate pain, nausea, anxiety, and more. The plant's primary secondary metabolites are cannabinoids, which interact with the endocannabinoid system to produce these effects. However, due to the dosage variability and the secondary effects associated with a lack of targeted action, their medical use is limited, creating the need for effective delivery systems. METHODOLOGY: This systematic patent review on cannabis drug delivery systems was conducted using patents retrieved from the Espacenet database. The search employed the keywords \"Cannabis\" and \"Delivery,\" along with the IPC classification code A61, to filter patents filed between 2012 and 2024. This initial search yielded 99 patents, which were further screened to identify 15 patents that met the inclusion criteria. RESULTS: Of the selected patents, most originated from the United States, followed by Canada, international patents (WIPO), and China. A notable increase in patent filings occurred in 2022, coinciding with the peak in scientific publications on the topic. This trend indicates a growing interest in the design of cannabis delivery systems. DISCUSSION: The historical importance and therapeutic potential of Cannabis sativa are welldocumented, yet modern medical use remains restricted due to pharmacokinetic limitations. Delivery systems such as extracellular vesicles, microneedles, and emulsions have been developed to improve the bioavailability and stability of cannabinoids. Extracellular vesicles facilitate targeted, noninvasive delivery of cannabinoids to the central nervous system. Microneedles offer a painless method for transdermal administration, overcoming skin barrier limitations. Emulsions improve the solubility and bioavailability of lipophilic cannabinoids, making them suitable for various administration routes. CONCLUSION: Since 2012, there has been considerable growth in patents and publications related to cannabis drug delivery systems, driven by the therapeutic potential of cannabinoids. Innovations in delivery systems like emulsions, microneedles, and extracellular vesicles aim to improve the pharmacokinetics and therapeutic efficacy of cannabis-derived compounds, representing a shift towards medical cannabis applications.",

      "abstract": "Cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive phytocannabinoid derived from Cannabis sativa, has emerged as a promising therapeutic agent due to its diverse pharmacological properties, including potent anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, and immunomodulatory effects. CBD modulates immune responses, including the regulation of T cell activity, induction of macrophage apoptosis, suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and modulation of signaling pathways involved in inflammation and immune homeostasis. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases to identify relevant preclinical and clinical studies on CBD's immunomodulatory effects. Preclinical and clinical studies demonstrate its efficacy in treating autoimmune diseases such as Type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease, along with its potential in neuropathic pain and cancer therapy. Recent advancements in nanotechnology-based delivery systems have further enhanced CBD's therapeutic potential by improving its solubility, bioavailability, and targeted delivery, enabling innovative approaches for wound healing, inflammation management, and cancer treatment. However, challenges such as variability in immune responses, limited long-term safety data, and potential drug-drug interactions persist. This review comprehensively examines CBD's pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and immunomodulatory mechanisms, highlighting its clinical potential, existing limitations, and future directions in advancing its integration into precision medicine and immune regulation.",

      "abstract": "Phytocannabinoids are natural products with highly promising pharmaceutical potential, mainly known from the plant Cannabis\u00a0sativa. However, their bioavailability is limited due to their high lipophilicity. Modification through glycosylation is known to improve the water solubility and stability of molecules. Enzymatic glycosylation requires specific enzymes with high catalytic activity in combination with efficient production systems. To date, only a few glycosyltransferases with activity toward cannabinoids have been described. In this study, we explore the substrate spectrum of the promiscuous UDP-glycosyltransferase CrUGT74AN3 from Catharanthus\u00a0roseus and demonstrate activity towards a broad range of cannabinoids and their biosynthetic intermediates. The highest activity was observed using cannabidiol (CBD) as an acceptor molecule. In addition, we show efficient biotransformation of CBD in an engineered Saccharomyces\u00a0cerevisiae strain. We investigate the influence of the hydrolytic activity of endogenous glucosidases and identify the UDP-glucose supply as a limiting factor in the yeast system. The co-expression of CrUGT74AN3 and a cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase from Bacillus\u00a0licheniformis in the engineered yeast strain led to the production of CBD-glycosides with up to six glucose moieties from CBD and cyclodextrin in\u00a0vivo. Finally, we confirm the applicability of the engineered yeast systems to other cannabinoids using cannabigerol and cannabinol.",

      "title": "Cannabis Use and Its Association with Complications and Outcomes in Burn Patients: Insights from the National Trauma Data Bank.",
      "abstract": "Cannabis use has increased with expanding legalization and societal acceptance, raising questions about its impact on burn care. Given its known effects on pain perception, metabolism, and immune modulation, cannabis may influence various aspects of burn treatment, including pain management, wound healing, and rates of infection. This study explores trends in cannabis use among burn patients and evaluates its association with clinical outcomes using the National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB). The NTDB was used to identify burn patients from 2017 to 2021, isolating burn injuries through e-code variables. Cannabis use was documented at admission, and patients without screening data were excluded. The primary exposure variable was cannabis use, with outcomes including mortality, stroke, myocardial infarction, organ failure, timing of surgery, and post-surgical complications. Secondary outcomes included ED vital signs, length of stay, and intensive care needs. Multivariable regression models were applied to analyze the association between cannabis use and outcomes. Of 319\u2009941 burn patients, 52\u2009803 (16.5%) tested positive for cannabis. Cannabis-positive patients were more likely to be male (18% vs. 11%, p<.001) and younger (28.9 vs. 32.6\u00a0years, p<.001). They had higher rates of venothromboembolic events, required longer ICU stays, and were more likely to develop ventilator-associated pneumonia. Additionally, cannabis-positive patients had a higher incidence of organ failure (2.1% vs. 1.3%, p=.012) and reoperations (5.2% vs. 4.1%, p=.019). Cannabis use in burn patients is associated with more complex recoveries, including higher risks of complications. Integrating cannabis screening into burn care protocols and further research is essential to optimize treatment strategies.",

      "title": "Effects of five cannabis oils with different CBD: THC ratios and terpenes on hypertension, dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis, oxidative stress, and CB1 receptor in an experimental model.",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common liver disorder caused by oxidative stress and dysregulation of lipid metabolism. The endocannabinoid system (ECS), particularly the type 1 cannabinoid (CB1) receptor, plays a crucial role in NAFLD progression. Cannabinoids, such as cannabidiol (CBD) and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), along with terpenes, such as beta-myrcene and d-limonene, have shown potential therapeutic effects on liver health, particularly in reducing oxidative stress and modulating lipid metabolism. This study aimed to analyse the effects of five cannabis oils (COs), each with different CBD:THC ratios and terpenes content, on hypertension, dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis, oxidative stress, and CB1 receptor expression in an experimental model of NAFLD induced by a sucrose-rich diet (SRD) in Wistar rats for 3 weeks. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were fed either a: (1) reference diet (RD; standard commercial laboratory diet) or a: (2) sucrose-rich diet (SRD) for 3 weeks. 3 to 7 SRD\u2009+\u2009CO as following: (3) SRD\u2009+\u2009THC; (4) SRD\u2009+\u2009CBD; (5) SRD\u2009+\u2009CBD:THC 1:1; (6) SRD\u2009+\u2009CBD:THC 2:1; and (7) SRD\u2009+\u2009CBD:THC 3:1. The COs were administered orally at a dose of 1.5\u00a0mg total cannabinoids/kg body weight daily. The cannabinoid and terpenes content of all COs used in the study was determined. The terpenes found in COs were beta-myrcene, d-limonene, terpinolene, linalool, beta-caryophyllene, alpha-humulene, (-)-guaiol, (-)-alpha-bisabolol. During the experimental period, body weight, food intake and blood pressure were measured. Serum glucose, triglyceride, total cholesterol, uric acid, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (AP) levels were evaluated. Liver tissue histology, NAFLD activity score (NAS), triglyceride and cholesterol content, lipogenic enzyme activities, enzyme related to mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, reactive oxygen species (ROS), thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS), and antioxidant enzyme activities were also evaluated. The CB1 receptor expression was also determined. RESULTS: The results showed that SRD-fed rats developed hypertension, dyslipidemia, liver damage, hepatic steatosis, lipid peroxidation, and oxidative stress. This was accompanied by upregulation of liver CB1 receptor expression. CBD-rich CO, CBD:THC 1:1 ratio CO; CBD:THC 2:1 ratio CO and CBD:THC 3:1 ratio CO showed antihypertensive properties. THC-rich CO, CBD:THC 1:1 ratio CO; CBD:THC 2:1 ratio CO showed the greatest beneficial effects against hepatic steatosis and liver damage. All COs exhibited antioxidant effects in liver tissue. This was associated with normal liver CB1 receptor expression. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that COs, particularly THC-rich CO, CBD:THC ratio 1:1 CO, CBD:THC ratio 2:1 CO and terpenes, can effectively reduce dyslipidemia, liver damage and hepatic steatosis in SRD-induced NAFLD. COs with a higher proportion of CBD in their composition showed antihypertensive properties. All the COs exhibited antioxidant properties. These findings suggest that COs, especially those with CBD:THC ratios of 1:1 and 2:1 and terpenes, may represent a promising therapeutic approach for managing NAFLD and preventing its progression to more severe liver disease.",

      "title": "In Silico Assessment of Cannabidiol From Cannabis sativa as an Antiviral Agent Against Key Shrimp Pathogens in Aquaculture.",
      "abstract": "Shrimp aquaculture plays a crucial role in global food production but is increasingly threatened by viral and microsporidian pathogens such as White Spot Syndrome Virus (WSSV), Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei (EHP) and Infectious Hypodermal and Haematopoietic Necrosis Virus (IHHNV). Conventional reliance on antibiotics to combat these infections has raised serious concerns regarding antimicrobial resistance, environmental contamination and food safety. Additionally, environmental stressors such as salinity shifts and poor water quality exacerbate disease outbreaks, leading to severe production losses across Asia and Latin America. To explore eco-friendly therapeutic alternatives, this study assessed the antiviral potential of cannabidiol (CBD), a bioactive compound extracted from Cannabis sativa seed oil, identified through GC-MS analysis. Using molecular docking techniques, we evaluated CBD's interactions with key viral proteins: VP28 of WSSV, the tubulin \u03b2-chain of EHP and the capsid protein of IHHNV. The docking results revealed strong binding affinities of -6.61\u2009kcal/mol (EHP), -6.72\u2009kcal/mol (IHHNV) and -5.38\u2009kcal/mol (WSSV), indicating stable and potentially inhibitory interactions. Structural models were retrieved from RCSB PDB and SwissModel, while ligand preparation and docking were performed using AutoDock 4.2. CBD also demonstrated favourable pharmacokinetic and safety profiles, with predictions indicating no mutagenicity, hepatotoxicity or cardiotoxicity, and acceptable drug-likeness characteristics. Compared to other plant-derived compounds previously tested in shrimp disease models, CBD exhibited superior binding stability, more interaction residues and better bioavailability scores. These findings highlight CBD as a promising dual-function agent, capable of both modulating shrimp immunity and directly inhibiting key viral pathogens. These findings highlight cannabidiol (CBD) as a promising dual-action compound, with the potential to both enhance shrimp immune responses and exert direct antiviral effects against key pathogens. This study lays a robust groundwork for future in\u00a0vivo validations, formulation strategies and regulatory frameworks, ultimately supporting the development of sustainable, precision-based aquaculture health management.",

      "abstract": "Alcohol use disorder (AUD) remains a pervasive public health issue with limited effective treatments. Cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychotropic constituent of cannabis, shows promise in modulating addictive behaviors. This study investigated the effects of chronic CBD administration on alcohol dependence, withdrawal symptoms, and neurodegeneration using two complementary rodent models: chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) exposure, which models established alcohol dependence, and ethanol vapor self-administration (EVSA), which captures the volitional aspects of alcohol intake. In the CIE model, CBD reduced alcohol self-administration during acute withdrawal without affecting alcohol metabolism or locomotor activity. CBD decreased motivation for alcohol, somatic withdrawal signs, withdrawal-induced anxiety-like behaviors, and mechanical sensitivity. During extinction, CBD attenuated alcohol-seeking behavior and stress-induced reinstatement. Electrophysiological recordings revealed that CBD reversed alcohol-induced decreases in neuronal excitability in the basolateral amygdala, suggesting a mechanism involving normalization of neural function. In the EVSA model, CBD reduced voluntary alcohol intake during the escalation phase, impacting voluntary alcohol intake. This effect was specific to alcohol-related behaviors, as it did not affect saccharin self-administration. Immunohistochemical analyses showed that CBD prevented alcohol-induced neurodegeneration in the nucleus accumbens shell and dorsomedial striatum, regions implicated in the volitional control of alcohol consumption. These findings indicate that chronic CBD administration attenuates both behavioral and neurobiological facets of alcohol dependence by modulating neuronal excitability and preventing neurodegeneration, supporting its therapeutic potential for AUD and providing mechanistic insights for future research.",

      "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major cause of cancer-related mortality with limited treatment options. Cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive compound from Cannabis sativa, has shown anticancer properties. This review analyzes CBD's therapeutic potential in HCC, focusing on mechanisms, preclinical/clinical findings, and integration into treatment strategies. A systematic search (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar) up to March 2025 identified 16 relevant studies (in vitro, in vivo, clinical). CBD exerts antitumor effects via multiple pathways, including apoptosis, autophagy regulation, metastasis suppression, and tumor microenvironment modulation. CBD interacts with the endocannabinoid system (ECS), inhibits oncogenic signaling (PI3K/AKT/mTOR), and enhances chemotherapeutic efficacy (sorafenib, cabozantinib). Studies show CBD induces pyroptosis via caspase-3/GSDME, and modulates autophagy by inhibiting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. It also sensitizes HCC cells to sorafenib and cabozantinib. Preclinical results are promising, but clinical studies are limited. Challenges like bioavailability and potential hepatotoxicity require investigation. Future research should optimize formulations, determine dosing, and conduct clinical trials to validate CBD's efficacy/safety in HCC patients. Validated CBD could offer an innovative HCC management option.",

However, its clinical usage is limited by its instability, minimal skin penetration, and poor solubility. Nanotechnology-based delivery systems such as Pickering emulsions, cryogels, lipid nanoparticles, and nanomicelles have emerged promising strategies to enhance localized skin delivery, improve penetration, enable sustained release, and reduce adverse effects. According to this analysis of 16 papers and 18 patents (2019-2024), CBD that has been nanoformulated offers improved tolerability, sustained release, and skin delivery. According to GRADE review, impacts on dermal absorption, inflammation, and wound healing demonstrated intermediate certainty, but outcomes such as skin penetration, controlled release, and safety showed high certainty. Applications for acne, psoriasis, and eczema show enhanced patient compliance and efficacy. Despite clinical and regulatory obstacles, nano-CBD platforms provide a safe, focused, and efficient approach to improving dermatological care.",

      "abstract": "Policy fragmentation contributes to the myriad environmental impacts of the cannabis industry and impedes solutions. Examination of how this plays out in the context of the US provides real-world examples, further complicated by the lack of a robust overarching federal policy framework. A key determinant of environmental problems is whether cannabis cultivation is conducted indoors (greenhouses or windowless plant factories) or outdoors in open fields. For example, emissions of greenhouse gases are \u223c100-times greater for indoor cultivation, and water use is higher when accounting for water associated with power production. Other distinct spheres of impact involve land use, waste production, air pollution, ecosystem degradation, and adverse indoor environmental quality conditions faced by workers. Some consequences are differentially burdensome for marginalized populations, suggesting an overlay of environmental justice considerations. Relevant but uncoordinated regulatory entities include those focused formally on cannabis regulation, law enforcement, energy supply and demand, building codes, air quality, climate change, water supply and quality, waste management, fish and wildlife, occupational safety, public health, and urban planning. While criminalization has contributed to environmental concerns, both legal and illicit operations are problematic. Cannabis legalization enables improved policy coordination, but is not a panacea or intrinsic solution. The potential for policymaker collaboration and regulatory coordination includes removing barriers to improved practices and, in particular, providing incentives for lower-impact outdoor cultivation. However, politics often stands as an impediment to otherwise pragmatic policy solutions.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common liver disorder caused by oxidative stress and dysregulation of lipid metabolism. The endocannabinoid system (ECS), particularly the type 1 cannabinoid (CB1) receptor, plays a crucial role in NAFLD progression. Cannabinoids, such as cannabidiol (CBD) and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), along with terpenes, such as beta-myrcene and d-limonene, have shown potential therapeutic effects on liver health, particularly in reducing oxidative stress and modulating lipid metabolism. This study aimed to analyse the effects of five cannabis oils (COs), each with different CBD:THC ratios and terpenes content, on hypertension, dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis, oxidative stress, and CB1 receptor expression in an experimental model of NAFLD induced by a sucrose-rich diet (SRD) in Wistar rats for 3 weeks. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were fed either a: (1) reference diet (RD; standard commercial laboratory diet) or a: (2) sucrose-rich diet (SRD) for 3 weeks. 3 to 7 SRD\u2009+\u2009CO as following: (3) SRD\u2009+\u2009THC; (4) SRD\u2009+\u2009CBD; (5) SRD\u2009+\u2009CBD:THC 1:1; (6) SRD\u2009+\u2009CBD:THC 2:1; and (7) SRD\u2009+\u2009CBD:THC 3:1. The COs were administered orally at a dose of 1.5\u00a0mg total cannabinoids/kg body weight daily. The cannabinoid and terpenes content of all COs used in the study was determined. The terpenes found in COs were beta-myrcene, d-limonene, terpinolene, linalool, beta-caryophyllene, alpha-humulene, (-)-guaiol, (-)-alpha-bisabolol. During the experimental period, body weight, food intake and blood pressure were measured. Serum glucose, triglyceride, total cholesterol, uric acid, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (AP) levels were evaluated. Liver tissue histology, NAFLD activity score (NAS), triglyceride and cholesterol content, lipogenic enzyme activities, enzyme related to mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, reactive oxygen species (ROS), thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS), and antioxidant enzyme activities were also evaluated. The CB1 receptor expression was also determined. RESULTS: The results showed that SRD-fed rats developed hypertension, dyslipidemia, liver damage, hepatic steatosis, lipid peroxidation, and oxidative stress. This was accompanied by upregulation of liver CB1 receptor expression. CBD-rich CO, CBD:THC 1:1 ratio CO; CBD:THC 2:1 ratio CO and CBD:THC 3:1 ratio CO showed antihypertensive properties. THC-rich CO, CBD:THC 1:1 ratio CO; CBD:THC 2:1 ratio CO showed the greatest beneficial effects against hepatic steatosis and liver damage. All COs exhibited antioxidant effects in liver tissue. This was associated with normal liver CB1 receptor expression. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that COs, particularly THC-rich CO, CBD:THC ratio 1:1 CO, CBD:THC ratio 2:1 CO and terpenes, can effectively reduce dyslipidemia, liver damage and hepatic steatosis in SRD-induced NAFLD. COs with a higher proportion of CBD in their composition showed antihypertensive properties. All the COs exhibited antioxidant properties. These findings suggest that COs, especially those with CBD:THC ratios of 1:1 and 2:1 and terpenes, may represent a promising therapeutic approach for managing NAFLD and preventing its progression to more severe liver disease.",

      "title": "Characteristics and Trends in Child Cannabis Exposures During Legalization in California.",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: In 2016, California legalized cannabis for adult recreational use; after recreational sales began in 2018, it became the largest retail market worldwide. This study profiled specific risks and prevention opportunities across age groups and examined changes in medically significant child cannabis exposures before and after legalization. METHODS: Researchers conducted analyses, including interrupted time-series, to examine 1695 California Poison Control System (CPCS) reports of cannabis exposure in children 0-17 years of age, from 2010-2020. Analyses were confined to moderate and severe exposures, identified by CPCS toxicologists as requiring medical attention. RESULTS: Monthly rates of moderate/severe cannabis exposure per million children increased following legalization (\u03b2=0.06, CI [0.05, 0.08]), especially in children under 5. Fourteen percent required critical care admission. Exposures were primarily unintentional in younger children (87.7-99.2%) and intentional in adolescents (85.5%). Across all ages, most exposures occurred in the home (94.0%) and involved edible products (83.5%). An analysis of packaging on edible brands frequently cited in health records found that most could be easily mistaken for popular candies and snack foods. CONCLUSIONS: Following cannabis legalization in California, reports of child cannabis exposures requiring medical attention increased significantly. Most reported cannabis exposures occurred in the home through the ingestion of edible products, often packaged to look like popular candy and snack food brands. To prevent these harms, cannabis legalization should be accompanied by robust marketing and packaging regulations (e.g., plain labels, larger warning labels). Secondary prevention should focus on educating parents and caregivers on safe cannabis storage in the home.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This review article addresses the vaping chemistry of manufactured cannabis concentrates-a topic that remains under-researched despite the widespread availability and growing popularity of these products. Given their current prevalence and the fact that many of the findings discussed herein are from early-stage investigations, further research is essential to fully assess the public health risks associated with concentrate use. The purpose of this article is to help begin to bridge this knowledge gap by outlining the technical challenges of studying cannabis concentrates and to present evidence-based data concerning toxicant exposures as a foundation for future investigations. METHODS: A search of cannabis concentrate vaping within the date range of 2019-2025 on Google Scholar returned approximately 2,700 hits. A cannabis concentrate was defined as a sample containing at least 50% (w/w) cannabinoids. In addition to our group's articles, the search results contained six manuscripts that described at least a partial focus on molecular emissions specifically derived from vaping or dabbing samples that included cannabis concentrates. FINDINGS: Studying cannabis concentrate vaping poses distinct technical challenges that differ from those associated with electronic nicotine delivery systems. Emissions from vaping concentrates contain a substantial proportion of harmful aerosol toxicants, including isoprene, 3-methylcrotonaldehyde, 3-methyl-1-butene, and 2-methyl-2-butene. Moreover, some concentrate formulations have contained hazardous additives such as pine rosin and ketene precursors such as cannabinoid acetates. As with nicotine vaping, the presence of oxygen plays a critical role in driving the formation of many toxic chemical degradation products during vaping. CONCLUSION: Since the legalization of recreational cannabis, concentrates have become one of the most rapidly expanding segments of the U.S. cannabis market. However, research into the specific health risks of vaping these products has significantly lagged their widespread use. The studies presented in this review article highlight the potential for exposure to known toxicants during the vaping of cannabis concentrates.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Screw press extraction is widely used due to its simplicity and efficiency, but the impact of extraction temperature on oil characteristics requires further study. Existing studies highlight that high temperatures can improve yield but compromise oil quality. This study aims to assess the effects of different screw press extraction temperatures on hemp oil yield, composition and quality. METHODS: The study was conducted to examine the influence of screw press extraction temperatures (30, 60, 80, 100, 120 and 140\u00a0\u00b0C) on hemp oil yield and quality. Extracted oils were analyzed according to key parameters, including oil yield, total phenolic content, tocopherols, oxidation stability index (OSI), pigments, quality indices (free fatty acids (FFA), peroxide value (PV), conjugated diene (K232) and conjugated triene (K270)), fatty acid profiles and color parameters (L*, a*, b*, C* RESULTS: The temperature played a key role in yield, reaching a maximum of 21.82%, representing an oil recovery of 66.68% at 100\u00a0\u00b0C, an improvement of approximately 4% over cold pressing (30\u00a0\u00b0C). Increasing the extraction temperature from 30\u00a0\u00b0C to 140\u00a0\u00b0C resulted in an increase in tocopherol content from 410.84\u00a0mg/kg to 512.98\u00a0mg/kg. On the other hand, temperature had no significant effect on the TPC, which varied from 31.76\u00a0mg GAE/kg to 41.89\u00a0mg GAE/kg as confirmed by HPLC-DAD/ESI-MS\u00b2 analysis. On the other hand, oils extracted at higher temperatures were lower in quality, with higher PV, ranging from 6.36 meq O CONCLUSION: Extraction temperature has a significant influence on the yield and quality of hemp oil. Underline the importance of selecting the optimum extraction temperature to balance yield and quality.",

      "abstract": "Iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) have emerged as the most widely synthesized metal nanoparticles in sustainable chemistry due to their unique magnetic properties, excellent biocompatibility, biodegradability, and non-toxicity. In this study, IONPs are successfully synthesized via a rapid, sustainable, and environmentally friendly green synthesis approach using Cannabis sativa L. leaf extract. X-ray diffraction analysis determined that the synthesized NPs had an average particle size of 18.8\u2009nm, while transmission electron microscopy images reveal a spherical morphology with sizes ranging from 12 to 21\u2009nm. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy analysis confirmed the presence of cannabinoids, terpenoids, and flavonoids, which are believed to play a crucial role in the formation and stabilization of IONPs. Its photocatalytic potential is demonstrated through the degradation of bromophenol blue dye. Additionally, the NPs exhibited significant antibacterial and antifungal activity against various microbial species, along with promising anticancer effects on cancer cell lines. In conclusion, this study provides a promising foundation for advancing the large-scale, commercial production of IONPs through green synthesis methods. By offering an eco-friendly and efficient alternative to conventional nanoparticle synthesis, the findings contribute significantly to the growing body of research in sustainable nanotechnology.",

The fungal endophytes Metarhizium robertsii and Pochonia chlamydosporia were previously shown to improve hemp growth. Here, the impact of three fungal endophytes, M. robertsii, P. chlamydosporia as well as Trichoderma harzianum on hemp was investigated under treatment with 300\u2009mM NaCl as a salinity stress and reduced watering volume as a drought stress. Plant growth parameters, a lipid oxidation indicator, leaf porphyrins together with the abiotic stress responses genes were assessed in hemp with or without fungal colonization under normal and stressed conditions. Under salinity stress, the growth of hemp was ameliorated by the application of Metarhizium, Pochonia, or Trichoderma in the soil. The increased production of malondialdehyde (MDA) and the reduction in porphyrins in hemp under salinity stress were restored in the presence of fungal endophytes. Under drought stress, the aboveground growth of hemp was recovered by the application of Metarhizium together with the reduced production of porphyrins. The stress related gene CsNAC3 showed decreased expression during fungal application compared with uninoculated hemp under salinity or drought treatment. Colonization of Metarhizium, Pochonia or Trichoderma improved salt stress tolerance in hemp and this was accompanied by a reduction in oxidative stress.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Triterpenoid compounds such as betulinic acid (BA) and oleanolic acid (OA) exhibit considerable pharmacological activities. However, their current production primarily relies on plant extraction and chemical synthesis, methods that are often plagued by low efficiency, complex extraction processes, and environmental concerns. Microbial-based synthesis has emerged as one of the most effective approaches for producing BA and OA. RESULTS: This study presented the first identification of filamentous fungal strains efficiently synthesizing both BA and OA. The strain ZBS49 is a newly identified species of Clonostachys isolated from Gleditsia japonica Miq. (showing 99.82% sequence identity), produced 47.7\u00a0mg/L of BA. The strain XJ1-1, characterized as Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and isolated from Cannabis sativa L., yielded 65.76\u00a0mg/L of OA. After optimizing the culture medium and cultivation conditions, the yields of ZBS49 and XJ1-1 increased to 288.97 and 86.14\u00a0mg/L, representing improvements of 506% and 31%, respectively. Furthermore, we discovered that the BA extract of the ZBS49 strain significantly inhibited hepatocellular cancer cells (SMMC-7721 and HepG2) in a dose-dependent manner, with a minimum inhibitory concentration of 70 \u00b5M. Genomic analysis of Clonostachys sp. ZBS49 elucidated that the presence of 16 putative genes was related to triterpenoid biosynthesis and 6 distinct terpene biosynthetic gene clusters. Among the 145 CYP450, 5 genes involved in C-28 oxidation were predicted. CONCLUSIONS: This research underscores the effectiveness of filamentous fungi as a biotechnological platform for the efficient production of BA and its derivatives, highlighting their potential applications in cancer therapy. Furthermore, these findings provide valuable genetic resources and establish a robust technical and theoretical framework for utilizing ZBS49 as a microbial platform for the biosynthesis of triterpenoids.",

The gel contains the richest source of energy, and it is an effective way to provide energy and nutrients to athletes. The gel was prepared in three variations with different hemp seed concentrations. We then analyzed the gel for pH and macronutrient composition. The sensory characteristics were analyzed for seven parameters, including appearance, taste, color, texture, aroma, consistency, and acceptability, using a hedonic scale on 25 panelists. A sensory analysis showed that sample A received an overall acceptability score of 7.16 \u00b1 0.99 from the sensory panel. The shelf life was observed at the recommended temperature of 4 degrees Celsius, which was 12 days. The best formulation was sample B with 38 g of hemp seeds, which showed better taste, color, aroma, and acceptability and a lower average pH value (6.68 \u00b1 1.44, 6.56 \u00b1 1.29, 7.6 \u00b1 1.16, 7 \u00b1 1.26, and 5.822 \u00b1 0.0183, respectively). Sample B contained 30.8 g of protein, 16.09 g of carbohydrates, 8.4 g of fat, and 263.16 kcal of energy per 100 g.
