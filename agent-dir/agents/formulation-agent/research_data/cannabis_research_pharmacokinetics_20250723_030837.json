    "title": "Cannabis Use and Its Association with Complications and Outcomes in Burn Patients: Insights from the National Trauma Data Bank.",
    "abstract": "Cannabis use has increased with expanding legalization and societal acceptance, raising questions about its impact on burn care. Given its known effects on pain perception, metabolism, and immune modulation, cannabis may influence various aspects of burn treatment, including pain management, wound healing, and rates of infection. This study explores trends in cannabis use among burn patients and evaluates its association with clinical outcomes using the National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB). The NTDB was used to identify burn patients from 2017 to 2021, isolating burn injuries through e-code variables. Cannabis use was documented at admission, and patients without screening data were excluded. The primary exposure variable was cannabis use, with outcomes including mortality, stroke, myocardial infarction, organ failure, timing of surgery, and post-surgical complications. Secondary outcomes included ED vital signs, length of stay, and intensive care needs. Multivariable regression models were applied to analyze the association between cannabis use and outcomes. Of 319\u2009941 burn patients, 52\u2009803 (16.5%) tested positive for cannabis. Cannabis-positive patients were more likely to be male (18% vs. 11%, p<.001) and younger (28.9 vs. 32.6\u00a0years, p<.001). They had higher rates of venothromboembolic events, required longer ICU stays, and were more likely to develop ventilator-associated pneumonia. Additionally, cannabis-positive patients had a higher incidence of organ failure (2.1% vs. 1.3%, p=.012) and reoperations (5.2% vs. 4.1%, p=.019). Cannabis use in burn patients is associated with more complex recoveries, including higher risks of complications. Integrating cannabis screening into burn care protocols and further research is essential to optimize treatment strategies.",

    "title": "Effects of five cannabis oils with different CBD: THC ratios and terpenes on hypertension, dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis, oxidative stress, and CB1 receptor in an experimental model.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common liver disorder caused by oxidative stress and dysregulation of lipid metabolism. The endocannabinoid system (ECS), particularly the type 1 cannabinoid (CB1) receptor, plays a crucial role in NAFLD progression. Cannabinoids, such as cannabidiol (CBD) and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), along with terpenes, such as beta-myrcene and d-limonene, have shown potential therapeutic effects on liver health, particularly in reducing oxidative stress and modulating lipid metabolism. This study aimed to analyse the effects of five cannabis oils (COs), each with different CBD:THC ratios and terpenes content, on hypertension, dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis, oxidative stress, and CB1 receptor expression in an experimental model of NAFLD induced by a sucrose-rich diet (SRD) in Wistar rats for 3 weeks. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were fed either a: (1) reference diet (RD; standard commercial laboratory diet) or a: (2) sucrose-rich diet (SRD) for 3 weeks. 3 to 7 SRD\u2009+\u2009CO as following: (3) SRD\u2009+\u2009THC; (4) SRD\u2009+\u2009CBD; (5) SRD\u2009+\u2009CBD:THC 1:1; (6) SRD\u2009+\u2009CBD:THC 2:1; and (7) SRD\u2009+\u2009CBD:THC 3:1. The COs were administered orally at a dose of 1.5\u00a0mg total cannabinoids/kg body weight daily. The cannabinoid and terpenes content of all COs used in the study was determined. The terpenes found in COs were beta-myrcene, d-limonene, terpinolene, linalool, beta-caryophyllene, alpha-humulene, (-)-guaiol, (-)-alpha-bisabolol. During the experimental period, body weight, food intake and blood pressure were measured. Serum glucose, triglyceride, total cholesterol, uric acid, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (AP) levels were evaluated. Liver tissue histology, NAFLD activity score (NAS), triglyceride and cholesterol content, lipogenic enzyme activities, enzyme related to mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, reactive oxygen species (ROS), thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS), and antioxidant enzyme activities were also evaluated. The CB1 receptor expression was also determined. RESULTS: The results showed that SRD-fed rats developed hypertension, dyslipidemia, liver damage, hepatic steatosis, lipid peroxidation, and oxidative stress. This was accompanied by upregulation of liver CB1 receptor expression. CBD-rich CO, CBD:THC 1:1 ratio CO; CBD:THC 2:1 ratio CO and CBD:THC 3:1 ratio CO showed antihypertensive properties. THC-rich CO, CBD:THC 1:1 ratio CO; CBD:THC 2:1 ratio CO showed the greatest beneficial effects against hepatic steatosis and liver damage. All COs exhibited antioxidant effects in liver tissue. This was associated with normal liver CB1 receptor expression. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that COs, particularly THC-rich CO, CBD:THC ratio 1:1 CO, CBD:THC ratio 2:1 CO and terpenes, can effectively reduce dyslipidemia, liver damage and hepatic steatosis in SRD-induced NAFLD. COs with a higher proportion of CBD in their composition showed antihypertensive properties. All the COs exhibited antioxidant properties. These findings suggest that COs, especially those with CBD:THC ratios of 1:1 and 2:1 and terpenes, may represent a promising therapeutic approach for managing NAFLD and preventing its progression to more severe liver disease.",

    "title": "In Silico Assessment of Cannabidiol From Cannabis sativa as an Antiviral Agent Against Key Shrimp Pathogens in Aquaculture.",
    "abstract": "Shrimp aquaculture plays a crucial role in global food production but is increasingly threatened by viral and microsporidian pathogens such as White Spot Syndrome Virus (WSSV), Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei (EHP) and Infectious Hypodermal and Haematopoietic Necrosis Virus (IHHNV). Conventional reliance on antibiotics to combat these infections has raised serious concerns regarding antimicrobial resistance, environmental contamination and food safety. Additionally, environmental stressors such as salinity shifts and poor water quality exacerbate disease outbreaks, leading to severe production losses across Asia and Latin America. To explore eco-friendly therapeutic alternatives, this study assessed the antiviral potential of cannabidiol (CBD), a bioactive compound extracted from Cannabis sativa seed oil, identified through GC-MS analysis. Using molecular docking techniques, we evaluated CBD's interactions with key viral proteins: VP28 of WSSV, the tubulin \u03b2-chain of EHP and the capsid protein of IHHNV. The docking results revealed strong binding affinities of -6.61\u2009kcal/mol (EHP), -6.72\u2009kcal/mol (IHHNV) and -5.38\u2009kcal/mol (WSSV), indicating stable and potentially inhibitory interactions. Structural models were retrieved from RCSB PDB and SwissModel, while ligand preparation and docking were performed using AutoDock 4.2. CBD also demonstrated favourable pharmacokinetic and safety profiles, with predictions indicating no mutagenicity, hepatotoxicity or cardiotoxicity, and acceptable drug-likeness characteristics. Compared to other plant-derived compounds previously tested in shrimp disease models, CBD exhibited superior binding stability, more interaction residues and better bioavailability scores. These findings highlight CBD as a promising dual-function agent, capable of both modulating shrimp immunity and directly inhibiting key viral pathogens. These findings highlight cannabidiol (CBD) as a promising dual-action compound, with the potential to both enhance shrimp immune responses and exert direct antiviral effects against key pathogens. This study lays a robust groundwork for future in\u00a0vivo validations, formulation strategies and regulatory frameworks, ultimately supporting the development of sustainable, precision-based aquaculture health management.",

    "abstract": "Alcohol use disorder (AUD) remains a pervasive public health issue with limited effective treatments. Cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychotropic constituent of cannabis, shows promise in modulating addictive behaviors. This study investigated the effects of chronic CBD administration on alcohol dependence, withdrawal symptoms, and neurodegeneration using two complementary rodent models: chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) exposure, which models established alcohol dependence, and ethanol vapor self-administration (EVSA), which captures the volitional aspects of alcohol intake. In the CIE model, CBD reduced alcohol self-administration during acute withdrawal without affecting alcohol metabolism or locomotor activity. CBD decreased motivation for alcohol, somatic withdrawal signs, withdrawal-induced anxiety-like behaviors, and mechanical sensitivity. During extinction, CBD attenuated alcohol-seeking behavior and stress-induced reinstatement. Electrophysiological recordings revealed that CBD reversed alcohol-induced decreases in neuronal excitability in the basolateral amygdala, suggesting a mechanism involving normalization of neural function. In the EVSA model, CBD reduced voluntary alcohol intake during the escalation phase, impacting voluntary alcohol intake. This effect was specific to alcohol-related behaviors, as it did not affect saccharin self-administration. Immunohistochemical analyses showed that CBD prevented alcohol-induced neurodegeneration in the nucleus accumbens shell and dorsomedial striatum, regions implicated in the volitional control of alcohol consumption. These findings indicate that chronic CBD administration attenuates both behavioral and neurobiological facets of alcohol dependence by modulating neuronal excitability and preventing neurodegeneration, supporting its therapeutic potential for AUD and providing mechanistic insights for future research.",

Cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive compound from Cannabis sativa, has shown anticancer properties. This review analyzes CBD's therapeutic potential in HCC, focusing on mechanisms, preclinical/clinical findings, and integration into treatment strategies. A systematic search (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar) up to March 2025 identified 16 relevant studies (in vitro, in vivo, clinical). CBD exerts antitumor effects via multiple pathways, including apoptosis, autophagy regulation, metastasis suppression, and tumor microenvironment modulation. CBD interacts with the endocannabinoid system (ECS), inhibits oncogenic signaling (PI3K/AKT/mTOR), and enhances chemotherapeutic efficacy (sorafenib, cabozantinib). Studies show CBD induces pyroptosis via caspase-3/GSDME, and modulates autophagy by inhibiting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. It also sensitizes HCC cells to sorafenib and cabozantinib. Preclinical results are promising, but clinical studies are limited. Challenges like bioavailability and potential hepatotoxicity require investigation. Future research should optimize formulations, determine dosing, and conduct clinical trials to validate CBD's efficacy/safety in HCC patients. Validated CBD could offer an innovative HCC management option.",

According to this analysis of 16 papers and 18 patents (2019-2024), CBD that has been nanoformulated offers improved tolerability, sustained release, and skin delivery. According to GRADE review, impacts on dermal absorption, inflammation, and wound healing demonstrated intermediate certainty, but outcomes such as skin penetration, controlled release, and safety showed high certainty. Applications for acne, psoriasis, and eczema show enhanced patient compliance and efficacy. Despite clinical and regulatory obstacles, nano-CBD platforms provide a safe, focused, and efficient approach to improving dermatological care.",
