- Performance targets and accuracy requirements
- Cross-agent verification requirements
- Safety and compliance standards

### [Agent Benchmarks](./agent-benchmarks.md)
Comprehensive benchmarking framework including:
- Performance, accuracy, quality, and safety benchmark categories
- 300+ test scenarios across all agents
- Automated testing infrastructure
- Continuous monitoring and reporting
- Export capabilities for analysis

## Agent Performance Targets

| Agent Type | Accuracy Target | Response Time | Confidence Score |
|------------|----------------|---------------|------------------|
| Compliance | 95% | < 30 seconds | 85%+ average |
| Patent/Trademark | 90% | < 45 seconds | 80%+ average |
| Operations | 95% | < 25 seconds | 85%+ average |
| Formulation | 95% | < 35 seconds | 85%+ average |
| Sourcing | 90% | < 20 seconds | 85%+ average |
| Marketing | 100% compliance | < 30 seconds | 90%+ average |

## Cross-Agent Verification Matrix

The system implements intelligent cross-verification between agents to ensure accuracy:

- **Compliance ↔ Marketing**: All marketing content verified for regulatory compliance
- **Patent ↔ Formulation**: Novel formulations checked for IP conflicts
- **Operations ↔ Sourcing**: Equipment recommendations validated for compatibility
- **Marketing ↔ Patent**: Brand elements checked for trademark conflicts

## Quality Assurance

### Automated Testing
