- **Hardware Example:** Modern desktop or entry-level workstation (Dell OptiPlex, Mac Mini, Lenovo ThinkCentre)
- **Cost:** **$800–$1,500** (new), or **$400–$800** (refurbished/used)
- **Use Case:** Development, testing, or running 1–2 agents with moderate load

### 2. Startup Production Setup (Multiple Agents, No GPU)
- **Specs:** 8–16 CPU cores, 32–64GB RAM, 1TB+ SSD
- **Hardware Example:** Used/refurbished server (Dell PowerEdge, HP Z-series workstation)
- **Cost:** **$1,500–$3,000**
- **Use Case:** Run 3–5 agents concurrently, moderate user load, basic redundancy

### 3. Optional GPU Acceleration
- **When Needed:** Only if you require fast molecular/spectral analysis (Formulation/Spectra agents)
